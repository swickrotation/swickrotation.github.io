(IN PROGRESS)
    Appendix A todo:
        Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution
        Kinetic Theory
        Equipartition
        Derivation of IGL from equipartition theorem
    
    Appendix B todo:
        Write about spin states in QM

introduction to geometry
Introduction to elementary black hole physics

after those preliminaries have been covered,

solutions for non-stationary black holes 
penrose processes 
temperature at surface gravity

This is going to take a looooong time...
