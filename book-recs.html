				<h1>Textbook Reviews</h1>
				<hr>
				<div class="in-content">
					<p>
						At the risk of making an empty point, there are a lot of textbooks out there. Some are bad, most will get you what you need, and a select few are really important. This last category populated by what are termed "canonical" texts: they're the ones everyone who wants to attain mastery of the subject should read.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here's a list of some of the texts I have read. I'll make notes of the ones that are important texts in their fields.

				<h4>Classical Mechanics</h4>
				<hr>
				<div class="in-content">
				<h5><i>Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems</i>, J. Marion & S. Thornton</h5>
				<p>This textbook is really junk. Unfortunately, it's found itself a little niche in the physics curriculum because it's one of the few (and easily the most popular) book written for the level of study you'll probably be at by the time you take your first "real" (non-introductory level) courses on classical mechanics. At Waterloo, the AMATH department uses Taylor's <i>Classical Mechanics</i>, which I hear (but have not confirmed) is a superior text.
				</p>
				<p>Don't get me wrong, M&T has everything you need per se, but it gets lost in itself with clumsy formalism. It attempts to be a more mathematical view of classical mechanics without the elegance it could avail itself of in so-doing. If at all possible, steer clear.
				</p>

				<h5><i>A Course of Theoretical Physics Vol. I: Mechanics</i>, L. Landau & E. Lifshitz</h5>
				<p>This is arguably one of the most beautiful physics books I've ever read, but it is absolutely not for the faint of heart. Landau takes no prisoners when it comes to exposition: by page three, he's already derived the Euler-Lagrange equation of action. Do not use this as a first text- instead, save it for when you understand the field better. You'll see just how brilliant it is then.
				</p>

				<h5><i>Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics</i>, V. I. Arnold</h5>
				<p>This one, with Goldstein, have the reputations as the strongest treatment of classical mechanics at the graduate level. Arnold has written this text with the mathematician in mind, so be prepared for some differential geometry- I'm talking tangent spaces, vector bundles, manifolds, symplectic spaces, the works. However, this will get you prepared to talk general relativity, and apparently gauge theories, so take it in the teeth. You'll be happy you did.

				<h4>Electrodynamics</h4>
				<hr>
				<div class="in-content">
				<h5><i>Introduction to Electrodynaimcs</i>, D. J. Griffiths</h5>
				<p>Without a doubt, this is the strongest of Griffith's three texts. It's a strong, intermediate text that's fairly self-contained. Like all of his books, he's a little wordy, but in a field that's as mathematically nit-picky as electrodynamics, you'll appreciate the exposition for this first text. It's also pretty well the universal undergraduate textbook in this field, and you'll use it for all three courses if you're at UW. I actually recommend buying this one, you'll probably keep it after you graduate.

				<h4>Quantum Mechanics</h4>
				<hr>
				<div class="in-content">
				<h5><i>Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</i>, D. J. Griffiths</h5>
				<p>I personally don't like the approach taken in this text. It's a little clunky, just laying the Schrodinger equation on you on the first page. The philosophy of the book is to "shut up and calculate", which is fine for someone who wants to do well on their finals but doesn't care about how the theory is developed. I don't mean to knock the book, it's just not what I'd pick up if I had a choice. The treatment of the hydrogen atom in chapter 4 was pretty solid, in my opinion. I just wouldn't trust the text as a referrence for long-term use. I traded my copy to a friend for his copy of Wald's <i>General Relativity</i>, and haven't looked back.
				</p>

				<h5><i>Modern Quantum Mechanics</i>, J. J. Sakurai, J. Napolitano</h5>
				<p>This is the standard amongst first year graduate students taking courses in quantum mechanics. In truth, I haven't read this book all-the-way through, but what I've read so far is solid. The main author, Sakurai, died before finishing the book, and apparently this caused the last two chapters to suffer. The only complaint that I can bring to bare on the text thus far is that Sakurai skips many steps, and that makes following his arguments rather painful at times. I can understand trying to cut down to make your arguments elegant, but at times I've had to take up a board to understand some things that Sakurai simply writes in a line. Anyway, the "modern" part is really apt- Sakurai organizes the entire text, it seems around symmetry principles.
