                        This is pretty much gonna be the same idea as the physics review list. 
                        I only split them up because it makes things easier to find.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here's a list of some of the math texts I have read. I'll make notes of 
                        the ones that are important texts in their fields, but I can speak a 
                        little more expertly about the physics texts because that's more my area.

                    <p>
                        Alright, here's a partial (and partially ordered) list of mathematical texts I've read. The list is, for the moment, probably
                        going to be sigificantly shorter than the one for physics books. That's because I've read more physics
                        books all the way through, and because I learned an awful lot of the math I know out of course notes
                        and from the internet, and less so from books by-and-large. I'll try to keep things on the level,
                        but it might get a little hazy where things should be- you could find a measure theory text in either
                        analysis or probability theory, and it's gonna depend on which approach the text took.

                        <i>Set Theory and Metric Spaces</i>, Irving Kaplansky</h5>
                        <p>
                            Kaplansky's book is old-school, at times archaic, and uses fairly out-moded notation 
                            and terminology. It's also, in my opinion, an excellent treatise on the elements of 
                            axiomatic set theory and metric spaces. Beginning with sets, set operations, and cardinality 
                            and continuing to cardinal and ordinal arithmetic and ZFC axioms. In the next section, it 
                            covers metric spaces, then completeness and compactness, and finally product spaces, the 
                            fixed-point theorem, and a teeny bit of category theory. It caps off with applications 
                            to topology and algebra. And all of that in just under 160 pages! Worth the read, 
                            and the problems are insightful without being oppressive.

                        Artin takes a largely computational approach to algebra and teaches linear algebra as a primer (and likely a review) before starting with the standard groups/fields/rings presentation of the subject- which spans the field up to Galois theory.

                        <i>Complex Analysis</i>, Lars Ahlfors</h5>
                        <p>
                            This is generally regarded as one of those textbooks that so-called "serious" mathematicians read in their
                            undergraduate studies. It hits all the major topics: complex numbers and functions, mappings, contour integration,
                            conformal mappings and so on, as well as some of the hot math topics like Riemann Zeta and analytic continuation.  
                            Ahlfors' text starts from a peculiar point- assuming very little in the way of knowledge of complex numbers, but 
                            simultaneously assuming that the reader has at least basic knowledge of abstract algebra. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I liked this book quite a bit, and found it to be a worthy supplement to the course notes for PMATH 352 at Waterloo. The problems I found to be of adequate difficulty to reinforce learning, without being so hard that they send you immediately to the solutions guide. My biggest criticism of the text is that the geometric allusions are fairly weak, in my opinion. If that were a greater concern, I would have included more figures and made more emphasis of the connections. They seem more like an afterthought.
