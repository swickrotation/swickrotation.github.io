				<p>
	                While we're usually introduced to the Ideal Gas Law as an
                    empirical result in its own right. The lucky among us may
                    seen a loose derivation of it as a combination of Charles's
                    law, Boyle's law, the Guy-Lussac law, and Avogadro's rule
                    somewhere around highschool chemistry. Ultimately, it is
                    often taught early enough that the student is expected to
                    absorb it and take it for granted.
                </p>

                <p> 
                   Interestingly, though, we can actually find a derivation of
                   the ideal gas law from the equipartition theorem and
                   Hamiltonian mechanics. While I will not go into so much
                   detail as to re-establish Hamiltonian mechanics from first
                   principles, it is worth the time to re-produce the
                   generalised equipartition theorem: itself a foundational
                   result of statistical mechanics.
				</p>

                <p>
                    However, as is often the case with foundational results, we
                    do not come by this most important theorem simply. In fact,
                    it is a result which to me is best proven at the end of a
                    long road beginning with a mathematical object called a
                    "symplectic manifold". We will delve into the particulars
                    to varying degrees of depth, as criticality dictates.
                </p>

                <h5 id="geometry">2. Geometrical Notions</h5>

                <p>
                    Before we can talk about symplectic manifolds however, we
                    need to have a slightly better understanding of differential
                    geometry. Much of this portion is going to be summary as we
                    will have covered the fundaments of the theory in the
                    preceding entries. To wit, I am going to assume the reader
                    is familiar with basic concepts in topology. We start with 
                    some definitions.

                <p>
                    <b>DEFINITION A1.2.1:</b> a <em>n-dimensional topological
                        manifold</em> $M$ is a pointed topological space that
                    fulfills the following three properties:
                    <div class="list">
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            $M$ is <em>Hausdorf</em>: for $p,q \in M, \exists
                            U, V \subset M$ such that $p \in U, q \in V, U 
                            \cap V = \emptyset$. In other words, any two
                            points in the topological space $M$ may be expressed
                            as members of disjoint neighbourhoods.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            $M$ is <em>Second-Countable</em>: $\exists \{A_i\}$
                            such that $M \subset \bigcup_i A_i, 
                            \left|\{A_i\}\right| \leq \aleph_0$. Again in plain
                            language, this means that there are a countable (if
                            not finite) union of topological spaces that when
                            "glued together" contain the topological space $M$.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            $M$ is <em>Locally n-Euclidean</em>: each point $x
                            \in M$ has a neighbourhood homeomorphic to an open
                            subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, i.e. $\forall x \in M
                            \exists$ open $U \subset M$ such that $x \in U$
                            and a homeomorphism $\phi$ that takes this
                            neighbourhood into an open set in $\tilde{U} \subset 
                            \mathbb{R}^n$: $\phi:U \rightarrow \tilde{U}$.
                            We remind ourselves that a homeomorphism is a 
                            continuous bijective map with a continuous inverse.
