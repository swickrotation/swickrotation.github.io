				<p>
				    Information theory, aside from being an interesting line of
                    research in itself, represents a profound intersection of
                    disciplines. There are information-theoretic questions and
                    lines of reasoning being used by mathematicians, engineers,
                    theoretical computer scientists, and both theoretical and
                    experimental physicists. For our purposes, we will mainly be
                    looking at portions of interest to theoretical physicists
                    and mathematicians. In this section, we will focus mainly on
                    understanding fundamental results.

                <p>
                    For many, information theory as a field of research starts
                    with Claude Shannon's landmark paper, 
                    <a href ="https://culturemath.ens.fr/sites/default/files/p3-shannon.pdf">
                    "A Mathematical Theory of Communication"</a>, first
                    published in the Bell Systems Journal in 1948. In it,
                    Shannon posits some very reasonable properties about
                    signals coming from random source and explores the
                    consequences of these properties.  Starting with the case
                    of discrete noiseless sources and eventually generalizing
                    first to discrete noisy sources and eventually to
                    continuous signals. So many foundational results were
                    described in this paper that much of this article will be
                    devoted simply to its explanation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We start with a description of what we call a "communication
                    system". This is something best described by a diagram. 
                    <br> 
                    Here is a diagram.
                    <br>
                    <img src="com-scheme.png" alt="Diagram of a
                    communication system">
                </p>

                <p>
                    In its simplest form, this is what signal-based
                    communication looks like. As an example, say we're talking
                    about landline telephones. Starting from the speaker, the
                    sound reverberates on a diaphragm attached to some iron and
                    placed near a magnet. The motion of the magnetized  iron
                    induces an electric current which is transfered over wiring
                    to an operator. The operator on a switchboard then connects
                    the speaker to the intended recipient, whose own device
                    performs the reverse process to decode the message - turning
                    the recieved current into reverberation identical (up to
                    some noise) to that produced by the speaker. At just about
                    any of these points there is a capacty for noise to be
                    introduced - either from sheer loss in fidelity from the
                    equipment, or from intentional interference by say, the
                    operator in this example. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Now this is stripped down enough to be generalizable, but
                    that means for this to be useful we need to consider cases
                    with their own structure. The first such case we'll be
                    exploring is the simplest, and it's where Shannon starts
                    too: the discrete, noiseless channel. Discrete, noiseless
                    channels are communication schemes where the messages are
                    sent and received as discrete signals, and there is no
                    interference from the outside or within the equipment - an
                    idealized case, to be sure! Near approximations are
                    very well-designed telegraph machines, or shipboard signal
                    flags on a clear day. We also assume that the messages are
                    encoded with a finite character set - as in both of the
                    examples above.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shannon begins in a natural place in the description of such
                    schemes: with the capacity of the scheme itself. This
                    quantity is defined in the following way:

                    $$
                        C = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{log(N(T)}{T}
                    $$

                    where $N(T)$ is the number of number of allowed signals of
                    duration $T$.
                </p>
