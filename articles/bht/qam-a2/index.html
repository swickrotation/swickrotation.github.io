                <p>
                    The ferromagnetic alignments discussed in chapter 2 of
                    Schroeder's Thermal Physics are a simplification on what is
                    actually some fundamental quantum mechanics. While what is
                    written below is not strictly necessary for understanding
                    the sheer classical thermodynamics in section 1, this
                    subject is important enough on its own to deserve further
                    discussion. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pure, classical paramagnets are systems with particles
                    aligned randomly in the absence of an external field; only
                    becoming alinged after some field is applied to them. We
                    tend to think of the systems as non-self-interacting. In
                    this picture, the alignment of the dipoles are due to a
                    torque being applied to them by the external field &ndash;
                    the dipoles lining up parallel to the field lines. The
                    quantum picture of this alignment is closer to the truth, 
                    and requires greater detail. To understand, we first need
                    to grasp the concepts of angular momentum and spin in a 
                    quantum mechanical setting. We focus on what these terms
                    mean in the setting of the hydrogen atom, but much of what
                    is discussed is adaptable to other settings, including
                    ferromagnetic materials.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We start with spin. What we call "spin" in quantum mechanics
                    is a property of quantum objects. Spin can be understood as
                    an intrinsic angular momentum fundamentally ascribed to a
                    particle. It can be shown to exist observationally, by
                    recalling the Stern-Gerlach experiment. Crucially, it is
                    also be seen to be a quantized value: the deflection of
                    silver atoms in the inhomogeneous magnetic field causes the
                    particles to cluster in two points. Classically, one would
                    expect a uniform, continuous distribution &ndash; instead,
                    two distinct concentrations of particles are seen. The beam
                    being split in two necessitates that this intrinsic
                    ground-state spin could not be quantized as an integer. If
                    it were, the beam would be split into 3 parts: -1, 0, and 1.
                    It is concluded that the particles in the beam had an
                    intrinsic angular momentum of $\frac{1}{2}$, which is where
                    we get the term "spin-$\frac{1}{2}$". All known fermions
                    have half-integer spins, including the proton and electron
                    that make up the hydrogen atom. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Angular momentum requires some more serious mathematics, and
                    we explore this quantity as it relates to the system energy.
                    We ask what the Schrodinger equation predicts for the
                    stationary orbits of the electron in the hydrogen atom. We
                    get the following:
                    $$
                    \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 \psi 
                    - \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}\psi = E\psi,
                    $$
                    remembering that the potential energy for the orbit of the
                    electron is $\frac{-e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0r}$, and $\mu
                    =\frac{m_em_p}{m_e+m_p}$ is the center of mass between the
                    electron and the proton. We choose to work in spherical
                    coordinates. Now, try not to get discouraged: what I am
                    about to write is the meat and potatoes of what is learned
                    in a second course on quantum theory at the undergraduate
                    level. I will break it down into parts for easier
                    understanding. We take a deep breath and write the
                    Schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom in spherical
                    coordinates now.
                    $$
                    \frac{-\hbar^2}{2 \mu}
                    \left[\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}
                    \left(r^2\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}\right) + 
                    \frac{1}{r^2\sin \theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
                    \left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta}
                    \right) + \frac{1}{r^2\sin^2 \theta}
                    \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial \phi^2} \right] - 
                    \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}\psi = E\psi.
                    $$
                </p>

                <p>
                    From here we use a classic trick in partial differential
                    equations called "seperation of variables". The notion is to
                    seperate the PDE into seperate ODEs with independent
                    variables. In our case, we assume we can break our solution
                    into a radial component, $R(r)$, and an angular component,
                    $Y(\theta,\phi)$. That is, we write (up to a normalization)
                    $$
                    \psi(r,\theta,\phi) = R(r) \cdot Y(\theta,\phi).
                    $$
                    This means we can write
                    $$
                    \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r} = Y\frac{dR}{dr},
                    $$
                    and so on for the angular partial derivatives. With this in
                    mind, we're able to re-arrange the Schrodinger equation:
                    $$
                    \frac{Y}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right)+
                    \frac{R}{r^2 \sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
                    \left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial Y}{\partial \theta}\right)
                    + \frac{R}{r^2 \sin^2 \theta}
                    \frac{\partial^2Y}{\partial \phi^2} + \frac{2\mu}{\hbar^2}
                    \left(E + \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}\right)RY =0.
                    $$
                    Simplifying further, we can multiply by $r^2$ and divide by
                    $RY$. This gives us a well-seperated equation:
                    $$
                    \frac{1}{R}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right)+
                    \frac{R}{Y \sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
                    \left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial Y}{\partial \theta}\right)
                    + \frac{1}{Y \sin^2 \theta}
                    \frac{\partial^2Y}{\partial \phi^2}+\frac{2\mu r^2}{\hbar^2}
                    \left(E + \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}\right) =0.
                    $$
                    The first and fourth terms are radial, and the second and
                    third terms are angular. They are only able to balance if
                    they equate to the same constant, with opposite sign. We
                    call that constant $C$, and write a radial and angular
                    equation:
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & \frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right) 
                    + \frac{2 \mu r^2}{\hbar^2}
                    \left(E + \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}\right)R - CR = 0,\\
                    \\
                    & \frac{1}{\sin \theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
                    \left( \sin \theta \frac{\partial Y}{\partial \theta}\right)
                    + \frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta}\frac{\partial^2Y}{\partial \phi^2}
                    +CY = 0.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're not close to the end. In fact, there is much heavy
                    lifting yet to do. In particular, at this stage we need to
                    seperate the angular equation into its constituent parts,
                    and solve those portions. Then we need to solve the radial
                    equation. We start with the angular components. Assuming
                    that $Y(\theta, \phi) = \Theta(\theta) \cdot \Phi(\phi)$,
                    we write
                    $$
                    \frac{\Phi}{\sin \theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}
                    \left(\sin\theta\frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right) + 
                    \frac{\Theta}{\sin^2\theta}\frac{d^2\Phi}{d\phi^2}
                    + C\Phi\Theta = 0.
                    $$
                    In a similar way as we did with the Schrodinger equation, we
                    again multiply by $\sin^2 \theta$ and divide by
                    $\Phi\Theta$. Our new equation is
                    $$
                    \frac{\sin\theta}{\Theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}
                    \left(\sin\theta\frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right) + 
                    \frac{1}{\Phi}\frac{d^2\Phi}{d\phi^2}
                    + C\sin^2\theta = 0.
                    $$
                    Taking a new seperation constant $B$, we have a polar
                    equation and an azimuthal equation:
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & \frac{\sin\theta}{\Theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}
                    \left(\sin\theta\frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right) 
                    + C\sin^2\theta - B= 0,\\
                    \\
                    & \frac{1}{\Phi}\frac{d^2\Phi}{d\phi^2} + B = 0.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                    Now we can begin solving. I'm going to start with the
                    azimuthal portion, because it's the simplest. As anyone who
                    took first year physics should be able to recognize, this is
                    a 2nd order linear ODE with constant coefficients &endash;
                    it has a solution 
                    $$
                    \Phi(\phi) = a_1e^{im\phi}+a_2e^{-im\phi}
                    $$
                    with $B = m^2$. We may choose a coordinate system in which
                    $a_2 = 0$, and do so for simplicity. Something else of
                    interest: we see immediately from this that $m$ has to be
                    integer-valued: if it were not, there would be different
                    values for $\theta = 0$ and $\theta = 2\pi$. We dust off
                    our hands and say the solution to the azimuthal equation is
                    $$
                    \Phi(\phi) = a_1e^{im\phi}.
                    $$
                    Next up is the much more involved polar equation. Deep
                    breaths, we'll get through it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alright. Taking $B=m^2$ again, the polar equation is
                    $$
                    \frac{\sin\theta}{\Theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}
                    \left(\sin\theta\frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right) 
                    + C\sin^2\theta - m^2= 0.
                    $$
                    Rearranging,
                    $$
                    \frac{1}{\sin\theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}
                    \left(\sin\theta\frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right) 
                    + \left(C-\frac{m^2}{\sin^2\theta}\right)\Theta = 0.
                    $$
                    Now we do something very clever. We make a substitution:
                    $P(\cos\theta) \equiv \Theta(\theta) , x \equiv \cos\theta$.
                    Our differential changes, now, to
                    $$
                    \frac{d}{d\theta} = \frac{dx}{d\theta}\frac{d}{dx}
                    = -\sin\theta\frac{d}{dx}
                    $$
                    and
                    $$
                    \frac{1}{\sin\theta}(-\sin\theta)\frac{d}{dx}
                    \left(\sin\theta(-\sin\theta\frac{dP}{dx}\right)+
                    \left(C - \frac{m^2}{\sin^2\theta}\right)P = 0.
                    $$
                    We can make this cleaner. This rearranges to
                    $$
                    \frac{d}{dx}\left(\sin^2\theta\frac{dP}{dx}\right)+
                    \left(C-\frac{m^2}{\sin^2\theta}\right)P =0.
                    $$
                    Making the further substitution that $\sin^2t = 1- \cos^2t
                    = 1-x^2$, we get the following:
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & \frac{d}{dx}\left((1-x^2)\frac{dP}{dx}\right)+
                    \left(C-\frac{m^2}{1-x^2}\right)P =0\\
                    \\
                    & = (1-x^2)\frac{d^2P}{dx^2} - 2x\frac{dP}{dx} +
                    \left(C - \frac{m^2}{1-x^2}\right)P = 0.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                    Here's where things get a little ugly. This is still a
                    second-order ODE, but it no longer has constant
                    coefficients. The solutions are called "associated Legendre
                    polynomials", which are hairy enough that it makes me want
                    to write an appendix to the appendix. I'm gonna do it here,
                    but you can <a href ="#coward" >skip</a> to the solution
                    if you're not up to it. Here goes nothing. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We start with the case that $m=0$. Our ODE becomes
                    $$
                    (1-x^2)\frac{d^2P}{dx^2} - 2x\frac{dP}{dx} + CP = 0.
                    $$
                    We notice that the coefficient on the 2nd term is the
                    derivative of the coefficient on the first term. This leads
                    us to suspect that our kernel is probably $(1-x^2)$. The
                    multiple derivatives indicate we should make a substitution
                    along the lines of $w = (1-x^2)^n$ , $w' =
                    -2xn(1-x^2)^{n-1}$ which gives us the following relation:
                    $$
                    w'(1-x^2) +2nxw =0.
                    $$
                    However, repeated derivatives of this function don't give us
                    the form of equation we're looking for. We Take our original
                    equation and flip its sign:
                    $$
                    (x^2-1)\frac{d^2P}{dx^2} + 2x\frac{dP}{dx} - CP = 0,
                    $$
                    and we can use a similar substitution to find that, letting
                    $\omega = (x^2-1)^l$,
                    $$
                    \omega'(x^2-1) - 2nx\omega =0.
                    $$
                    The $l+1$th derivative of this statement gives you
                    $$
                    (x^2-1)\omega^{(l+2)}+2x\omega^{(l+1)}-l(l+1)\omega^{(l)},
                    $$
                    which <em>is</em> in the form we're looking for. This means
                    we may write, noting that $C = l(l+1)$ now, that
                    $$
                        P = \frac{d^l}{dx^l}(x^2-1), 
                    $$
                    which is the Legendre polynomial. This polynomial may be
                    rewritten as:
                    $$
                    P_l =\frac{1}{2^l l!} \frac{d^l}{dx^l}(x^2-1)^l.
                    $$
                    This is the "Rodrigues formula". And it's all well and good,
                    but it's still not what we're after &ndash; we don't
                    generally have $m=0$. Let's explore the non-zero case.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the same solution does not work. Our new
                    formulation would look something like
                    $$
                    (1-x^2)z''-2x(k+1)z'+(l(l+1)-k(k+1))z=0,
                    $$
                    if we took additional derivatives to power $k$ and replaced
                    things as we had in the previous paragraph. If, instead, we
                    recast the original equation (with non-zero $m$), we can get
                    something of the form
                    $$
                    (1-x^2)^2y''-2x(k+1)y'+(l(l+1)(1-x^2)-m^2)z=0.
                    $$
                    This indicates that the final function should be of the form
                    $$
                    \xi = (1-x^2)^a\frac{d^b}{dx^b}y_n.
                    $$
                    Immediately, we see that $b$ has to be a positive integer
                    &ndash; no Feynman half-derivative tricks allowed here.
                    Taking derivatives appropriately, we can see that if we 
                    force $y=x$ and let $b$ be 1,
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    &(1-x^2)\xi'' -2x\xi' + \left(l(l+1)-\frac{m^2}{1-x^2}\right)
                    \xi\\
                    & = -2a(1-x^2)^a+a(a-1)(4x^2)(1-x^2)^{a-1}\\
                    &\  + yx^2a(1-x^2)^{a-1}+l(l+1)(1-x^2)^{a-1}\\
                    &\  - m^2(1-x^2)^{a-1} = 0.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                    For this whole thing to be zero, we need the coefficients to
                    go to zero. This means we can coefficient-match our terms to
                    solve for $a$. Doing so,
                    $$
                    a(a-1)4x^2(1-x^2)^{a-1}+4x^2a(1-x^2)^{a-1}-m^2(1-x^2)^{a-1}
                    = 0,
                    $$
                    which yeilds that the relationship between coefficients of x
                    is
                    $$
                    4a^2 = m^2 \rightarrow a = \frac{|m|}{2}.
                    $$
                    Now we can finally put this all together, and the
                    relationship:
                </p>

                <p>
                    $$
                    P_l^m(x) = (1-x^2)^{\frac{|m|}{2}}\left(\frac{d}{dx}
                    \right)^{|m|}\left(\frac{1}{2^l l!}\right)\left(\frac{d}{dx}
                    \right)^l(x^2-1)^l,
                    $$
                    or,
                    $$
                    P_l^m(x) = (1-x^2)^{\frac{|m|}{2}}
                    \left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)^{|m|}P_l(x).
                    $$
                    The famous "associated Legendre function", our solution to
                    the polar equation. Notice the absolute values on $m$ here,
                    this will have consequences for our allowable quantum
                    numbers that will be discussed below. We often include in
                    our solution a factor of $(-1)^m$, though this is a matter
                    of convention as it is sometimes included in the definition
                    of the spherical harmonics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The last step (this is truly the most painful part) is for
                    us to find a constant that can normalize the angular
                    portion of our solution. We say that the non-radial solution
                    thus far is
                    $$
                    Y_l^m(\theta,\phi) = Ae^{im\phi}P_l^m\cos\theta.
                    $$
                    Using the Born rule, and noting that the radial and angular
                    portions of the wave function may be normalized seperately,
                    we see that
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi}\|Y_l^m\|^2\sin\theta d\theta
                    d\phi =1,\\
                    \\
                    & 2\pi A^2\int_{-1}^{1} \left(P_l^m(\cos\theta))\right)^2
                    \sin\theta d \theta =1.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                    We may substitute with our Rodrigues formula and with the
                    definition of the associated Legendre polynomials, as well
                    as setting $(x^2-1)=X$, to recover:
                    $$
                    2\pi A^2 \frac{(-1)^m}{2^{p+q}p!q!} \int_{-1}^1X^m
                    \frac{d^m}{dx^m}
                    \left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)^pX^p \frac{d^m}{dx^m}
                    \left(\frac{d^q}{dx^q}X^q\right)dx =1,
                    $$
                    which looks a little daunting. We can break this down. We
                    use integration by parts $m+q$ times to get
                    $$
                    2\pi A^2 \frac{(-1)^{2m+q}}{2^{p+qp!q!}}\int_{-1}^1
                    \frac{d^{m+q}}{dx^{x+q}}\left(X^m\frac{d^{m+p}}{dx^{x+p}}X^p
                    \right)X^qdx = 1.
                    $$
                    Then, the Leibniz formula allows us to express our integrand
                    as
                    $$
                    X^q
                    \frac{d^{m+q}}{dx^{x+q}}\left(X^m\frac{d^{m+p}}{dx^{x+p}}X^p
                    \right) = X^q \sum_{i=0}^{m+q} \frac{(m+q)!}{(m+q-i)!}
                    \frac{d^{m+q-i}}{dx^{m+q-i}}X^m\frac{d^{m+p+i}}{dx^{m+p+i}}
                    X^p
                    $$
                    First, we can see that $X^m$ has no power of $x$ greater
                    than $x^{2m}$, otherwise the integrand would go to zero.
                    Same goes for $X^p$ having no powers of $x$ greater than
                    $x^{2p}$. Jointly, this means that $m+q-i \leq 2m$ and
                    $m+p+i \leq 2p$, or $i \leq p-m, i \geq q-m$. This implies
                    that $q=p$, becuase otherwise the integral vanishes. We can
                    then write $i=q-m$, and proceed with that substitution:
                    $$
                    \int_{-1}^1 (P_q^m(x))dx = \frac{(-1)^{2m+q}(q+m)!(2q)!}
                    {2^{2q}(q!)^2(q-m)!(2m)!}\int_{-1}^1X^q\left(\frac{d^{2m}}
                    {dx^{2m}}X^m\right)\left(\frac{d^{2q}}{dx^{2q}}X^q\right)dx.
                    $$
                    Noting that $\frac{d^{2m}}{dx^{2m}}X^m = (2m)!$, this is the
                    same as writing
                    $$
                    \int_{-1}^1 (P_q^m(x))dx = \frac{(-1)^{2m+q}(q+m)!(2q)!}
                    {2^{2q}(q!)^2(q-m)!}\int_{-1}^1X^q dq.
                    $$
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now for something a little less straightforward. We
                    re-substitute $x = \cos \theta$ and write our integral in
                    terms of sine. Then we express the integrand as a beta
                    function, and further as gamma functions that will leave us
                    with a fairly clean factorial term as our result. It should
                    be noted that "seeing this" is not really expected. The way
                    I was taught, there wasn't this much detail &ndash; we were
                    supposed to just accept that the normalization factor
                    presented was just correct and move on. I would never
                    expect someone to calculate this result by hand and expect
                    the physicists who came up with this model, most notably
                    Bohr, used an integral table to get the answer that they
                    did. Anyway, for the curious I have done the calculation
                    below:
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & \int_{-1}^1X^qdx = (-1)^q2\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}
                    \sin^{2q+1} \theta d\theta = (-1)^{q+1}\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} 
                    \sin^{2(\frac{1}{2}(2q+2))-1}\theta \cos^{2(\frac{1}{2})-1}
                    \theta d\theta\\
                    \\
                    & = (-1)^q\frac{1}{2}\left(B\left(
                    2q+1,\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)
                    = (-1)^q\frac{1}{2}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{2q+2}{2}\right)
                    \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{2q+1}{2}+1
                    \right)} = (-1)^q \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}\frac{\Gamma(q+1}
                    {\Gamma \left(q+\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                    For the last term's denominator, we invoke the Legendre
                    duplication formula: $\Gamma(z)\Gamma(z+\frac{1}{2}) =
                    2^{1-2z}\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma(2z).$ Writing $\Gamma(q+\frac{3}{2}
                    )$ as $\Gamma((q+1)+\frac{1}{2})$, we rearrange and pass to
                    the Legendre formula. Plugging it all in, we get
                    $$
                    \int_{-1}^1X^qdx = \frac{(-1)^q(q!)^2(2^{2q+1}}{(2q+1)!}.
                    $$
                    Now we plug this back into our formula above, and we get
                    that
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & \left(\frac{(-1)^{2m+q}(q+m)!(2q)!}{2^{2q}(q!)^2(q-m)!}
                    \right)\left(\frac{(-1)^q(q!)^2(2^{2q+1})}{(2q+1)!}\right)\\
                    \\
                    & =(-1)^{2m+2q}\frac{2(q+m)!}{(2q+1)(q-m)!}= 1.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                    So letting $q=l$ and $\alpha = (-1)^{l+m}$, we write
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & A = \sqrt{\frac{(2l+1)(l-m)!}{2(l+m)!}},\\
                    \\
                    & Y_l^m(\theta , \phi) = 
                    \alpha \sqrt{\frac{(2l+1)(l-|m|)!}{4 \pi(l+|m|)!}}e^{im\phi}
                    P_l^m(\cos \theta).
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                    At this point, I encourage the reader who has worked through
                    this with me to take a sigh of relief and maybe a break,
                    because that's what I did.

                    Ok, so with the angular part squared away we can finish our

                    \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu r}\frac{d^2}{dr^2}\left(rR\right)
                    + \left(\frac{\hbar^2l(l+1)}{2\mu r}+|E| -\frac{e^2}{r}
                    \right)R = 0.
                    $$
                    We're writing an absolute value around $E$ because we're
                    actually interested in the negative energy eigenstates, as
                    they correspond to bounded (rather than scattering)
                    solutions. We make a load of substitutions here to simplify
                    our equation. I'll introduce them a few at a time rather
                    than all at once. If we take 
                    $|E| = \frac{\hbar^2\kappa^2}{2\mu}$, $\rho = 2\kappa r$,
                    $r^2 = \frac{\rho^2}{4\kappa^2}$,$d\rho = 2\kappa dr$,
                    $dr^2 = \frac{d\rho^2}{4 \kappa^2}$, we get
                    $$
                    \left(\frac{-4\kappa^2 d^2}{d \rho^2} 
                    + \frac{l(l+1)4\kappa^2}{\rho^2} 
                    - \frac{4\kappa^2\mu e^2}{\hbar^2 \rho} + \kappa^2
                    \right)u =0.
                    $$
                    Next, we substitute $a_o = \frac{\hbar^2}{\mu e^2}$,
                    $\lambda = \frac{1}{\kappa a_0} 
                    = \frac{\mu e^2}{\kappa \hbar^2}$. Now we have
                    $$
                    \left(\frac{-4\kappa^2 d^2}{d\rho^2} 
                    + \frac{l(l+1)4 \kappa^2}{\rho^2}
                    - \frac{4 \kappa^2 \lambda}{\rho} + \kappa^2
                    \right)u =0.
                    $$
                    Our final simplification is dividing out by $-4\kappa^2$:
                    $$
                    \left(\frac{d^2}{d\rho^2} 
                    - \frac{l(l+1)}{\rho^2}
                    + \frac{\lambda}{\rho} -\frac{1}{4} 
                    \right)u =0.
                    $$
                    The general solution to this kind of equation comes in the
                    form of a wave function, which we will call $j$, which is
                    described by its singular values, and a polynomial, $P$,
                    which we will discuss more later. That is, we write
                    $u = j_i\{s\}P(r)$, where the set $\{s\}$ are the singular
                    points particular to $j$. We need singular points at the
                    center of the atom, and at $n \rightarrow \infty$. We cover
                    the form of $j$ in those cases. First, the infinite distance
                    case &ndash; as $r$ gets very large, so does $\rho$ and our
                    middle two terms drop out. That leaves us with
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & \frac{d^2u}{d\rho^2}u -\frac{1}{4}u = 0i,\\
                    & \rightarrow u = e^{\frac{\pm \rho}{2}},\\
                    & \frac{d^2u}{d\rho^2}u -\frac{1}{4}e^{\frac{\pm \rho}{2}}
                    =0.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                    We in fact discard the positive solution, as it diverges for
                    large $\rho$.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now in the limit as $r \rightarrow 0$, we see that the
                    terms of import are only the first and second &ndash; the
                    other two don't grow quickly enough in the limit. We write
                    $$
                    \frac{d^2u}{d\rho^2} -\frac{l(l+1)}{\rho^2}u = 0.
                    $$
                    This is a second order ODE with variable coefficients, and
                    to solve it we need Frobenius's method of assuming a power
                    series solution i.e. that $u(\rho)$ is representable as
                    a power series. We can find part of our
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & u(\rho) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \alpha_i \rho^{i+b},\\
                    & u'(\rho) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}(i+b) \alpha_i \rho^{i+b},\\
                    & u''(\rho) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}(i+b)(i+b-1) \alpha_i 
                    \rho^{i+b-2}.\\
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                    Then,
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}(i+b)(i+b-1) \alpha_i \rho^{i+b-2} - 
                    (l(l+1)\rho^{-2} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \alpha_i \rho^{i+b}=0\\
                    & \rightarrow \sum_i \alpha_i \rho^{i+b-2} ((i+b)(i+b-1) -
                    l(l+1)) = 0.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                    As our sum $\sum_i \alpha_i \rho^{i+b-2} \neq 0$, we can
                    extract our $i=0$ term and find the allowable solutions for
                    $b$. We get that 
                    $$
                    b(b-1) - l(l+1) \rightarrow b = l+1, -l.
                    $$
                    Our second asymptotic solution for $u$ then is 
                    $\lim_{\rho \rightarrow 0}u(\rho) = A\rho^{l+1}+B\rho^{-l}$,
                    and we see that $B=0$ as otherwise the term blows up to
                    infinity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At this point, we write a cursory soluton: that 
                    $u(\rho) = \rho^{l+1}e^{\frac{-\rho}{2}}L(\rho)$. Plugging
                    this into our original equation and performing a large
                    amount of tedious but ultimately straightforward algebra, we
                    get that
                    $$
                    \rho \frac{d^2L}{d\rho^2}+ (2l+2-\rho)\frac{dL}{d\rho} 
                    + (\lambda -l -1)L = 0. \label{eq:laguerre} \tag{*}
                    $$
                    To get a recurrence relation for the coefficients of the
                    polynomial $L$, we suppose that $L$ is expressible as a
                    power series in terms of $\rho$ similar to how we found in
                    the Frobenius method above: we say $L= \sum_i a_i\rho^i$,
                    and so
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & \sum_i(i)(i-1)a_i\rho{i-1}+(2l+2)\sum_ia_i\rho^{i-1}
                    -\sum_ia_i\rho^i +(\lambda -l -1)\sum_ia_i\rho^i = 0\\
                    & = \sum_i[(i)(i-1) +(2l+2)(i)]a_i\rho^{i-1} 
                    - \sum_i[(i)+\lambda-l-1](a_i)\rho^i =0.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                    If we adjust the index of the first term to be $i' = i-1$,
                    we can rewrite our formula as
                    $$
                    \sum_{i}[(i'+1)(i') +(2l+2)(i'+1)]a_{i'+1}\rho^{i'} 
                    - \sum_i[(i)-\lambda+l+1](a_i)\rho^i =0.
                    $$
                    Now everything is of the same power, and we can replace
                    $i'$ with $i$ and establish our recursion relationship:
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & \sum_{i}[(i+1)(i) +(2l+2)(i+1)]a_{i+1}\rho^{i} 
                    - \sum_i[(i)-\lambda+l+1](a_i)\rho^i =0\\
                    & \rightarrow a_{i+1} = 
                    \frac{a_i(i-\lambda+l+1)}{(i+1)(i+2l+2)}.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                <p>
                    We need to make sure these polynomials don't blow up in the
                    limit of large $i$. Taking the ratio between $a_{i+1}$ and
                    $a_i$, we get that this approacjes $\frac{1}{i}$ for large
                    $i$, the same power series ratio between terms of a
                    positive exponential &ndash; we need the coefficients to 
                    tend to zero if this is going to converge. The recursion
                    relationship is a strictly mathematical result, to have a
                    physical meaning we need to allow for a maximal value of
                    $i$. To find this maximal value, we set
                    $a_{i+1} =0$, and find $0 = i_{\max} - \lambda +l+1$, or
                    $$
                    \lambda = l+1+i_{\max}. 
                    $$
                    From this relationship, we see that $\lambda$ takes an
                    integer value and that $\lambda \geq l+1$. If $l = 0$, as
                    it is allowed, we have that $\lambda =1$. This is the
                    lowest possible energy-value, showing that there is no zero
                    energy level for the bound energy states of the hydrogen
                    atom. That's pretty cool. We make the notational adjustment
                    $\lambda \rightarrow n$ and call this integer the "principal
                    quantum number". It is possible to show by direct 
                    substitution that the energy corresponding to different
                    energy levels is given by the formula
                    $$
                    E_n = - \frac{\mu e^4}{32 \pi^2 \epsilon_0^2 \hbar^2 n^2}.
                    $$

                    Final stretch. A polynomial that satisfies the equation
                    $\eqref{eq:laguerre}$ is called an
                    <em>associtated Laguerre Polynomial</em>. These are
                    well-studied, and have the form, again due to Rodrigues,
                    $$
                    L_n^k(x)= \frac{e^xx^{-k}}{n!}
                    \frac{d^n}{dx^n}(e^{-x}x^{n+k).
                    $$
                    They have the orthogonality and recursion relationships
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & int_o^{\infty} e^{-x}x^kL_n^k(x)L_m^k(x)
                    = \frac{(n+k)!}{n!} \delta_{nm},\\

                    \end{align}
                    $$

                <p>    
                    It turns out that this differential equation has a set of
                    solutions for a given energy $E$, which we index using the
                    "quantum numbers" $n$,$l$, and $m$. We write our solution as
                    $\psi_{n,l,m}(r,\theta,\phi)$.  The first of these quantum
                    numbers parameterizes the allowed values of the second, and
                    the second parameterizes the allowed values of the third:
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & n = 1,2,3,...,\\
                    \\
                    & l = 0,1,2,...,n-1,\\
                    \\
                    & m = -l, -l +1,...,l.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
