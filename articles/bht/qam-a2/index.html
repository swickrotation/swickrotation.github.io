                <p>
                    The ferromagnetic alignments discussed in chapter 2 of
                    Schroeder's Thermal Physics are a simplification on what is
                    actually some fundamental quantum mechanics. While what is
                    written below is not strictly necessary for understanding
                    the sheer classical thermodynamics in section 1, this
                    subject is important enough on its own to deserve further
                    discussion. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pure, classical paramagnets are systems with particles
                    aligned randomly in the absence of an external field; only
                    becoming alinged after some field is applied to them. We
                    tend to think of the systems as non-self-interacting. In
                    this picture, the alignment of the dipoles are due to a
                    torque being applied to them by the external field &ndash;
                    the dipoles lining up parallel to the field lines. The
                    quantum picture of this alignment is closer to the truth, 
                    and requires greater detail. To understand, we first need
                    to grasp the concepts of angular momentum and spin in a 
                    quantum mechanical setting. We focus on what these terms
                    mean in the setting of the hydrogen atom, but much of what
                    is discussed is adaptable to other settings, including
                    ferromagnetic materials.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We start with spin. What we call "spin" in quantum mechanics
                    is a property of quantum objects. Spin can be understood as
                    an intrinsic angular momentum fundamentally ascribed to a
                    particle. It can be shown to exist observationally, by
                    recalling the Stern-Gerlach experiment. Crucially, it is
                    also be seen to be a quantized value: the deflection of
                    silver atoms in the inhomogeneous magnetic field causes the
                    particles to cluster in two points. Classically, one would
                    expect a uniform, continuous distribution &ndash; instead,
                    two distinct concentrations of particles are seen. The beam
                    being split in two necessitates that this intrinsic
                    ground-state spin could not be quantized as an integer. If
                    it were, the beam would be split into 3 parts: -1, 0, and 1.
                    It is concluded that the particles in the beam had an
                    intrinsic angular momentum of $\frac{1}{2}$, which is where
                    we get the term "spin-$\frac{1}{2}$". All known fermions
                    have half-integer spins, including the proton and electron
                    that make up the hydrogen atom. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Angular momentum requires some more serious mathematics, and
                    we explore this quantity as it relates to the system energy.
                    We ask what the Schrodinger equation predicts for the
                    stationary orbits of the electron in the hydrogen atom. We
                    get the following:
                    $$
                    \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 \psi 
                    - \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}\psi = E\psi,
                    $$
                    remembering that the potential energy for the orbit of the
                    electron is $\frac{-e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0r}$, and $\mu
                    =\frac{m_em_p}{m_e+m_p}$ is the center of mass between the
                    electron and the proton. We choose to work in spherical
                    coordinates. Now, try not to get discouraged: what I am
                    about to write is the meat and potatoes of what is learned
                    in a second course on quantum theory at the undergraduate
                    level. I will break it down into parts for easier
                    understanding. We take a deep breath and write the
                    Schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom in spherical
                    coordinates now.
                    $$
                    \frac{-\hbar^2}{2 \mu}
                    \left[\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}
                    \left(r^2\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}\right) + 
                    \frac{1}{r^2\sin \theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
                    \left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta}
                    \right) + \frac{1}{r^2\sin^2 \theta}
                    \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial \phi^2} \right] - 
                    \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}\psi = E\psi.
                    $$
                </p>

                <p>
                    From here we use a classic trick in partial differential
                    equations called "seperation of variables". The notion is to
                    seperate the PDE into seperate ODEs with independent
                    variables. In our case, we assume we can break our solution
                    into a radial component, $R(r)$, and an angular component,
                    $Y(\theta,\phi)$. That is, we write
                    $$
                    \psi(r,\theta,\phi) = R(r) \cdot Y(\theta,\phi).
                    $$
                    This means we can write
                    $$
                    \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r} = Y\frac{dR}{dr},
                    $$
                    and so on for the angular partial derivatives. With this in
                    mind, we're able to re-arrange the Schrodinger equation:
                    $$
                    \frac{Y}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right)+
                    \frac{R}{r^2 \sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
                    \left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial Y}{\partial \theta}\right)
                    + \frac{R}{r^2 \sin^2 \theta}
                    \frac{\partial^2Y}{\partial \phi^2} + \frac{2\mu}{\hbar^2}
                    \left(E + \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}\right)RY =0.
                    $$
                    Simplifying further, we can multiply by $r^2$ and divide by
                    $RY$. This gives us a well-seperated equation:
                    $$
                    \frac{1}{R}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right)+
                    \frac{R}{Y \sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
                    \left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial Y}{\partial \theta}\right)
                    + \frac{1}{Y \sin^2 \theta}
                    \frac{\partial^2Y}{\partial \phi^2}+\frac{2\mu r^2}{\hbar^2}
                    \left(E + \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}\right)RY =0.
                    $$
                    The first and fourth terms are radial, and the second and
                    third terms are angular. They are only able to balance if
                    they equate to the same constant, with opposite sign. We
                    call that constant $C$, and write a radial and angular
                    equation:
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & \frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right) 
                    + \frac{2 \mu r^2}{\hbar^2}
                    \left(E + \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}\right)R - CR = 0,\\
                    \\
                    & \frac{1}{\sin \theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
                    \left( \sin \theta \frac{\partial Y}{\partial \theta}\right)
                    + \frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta}\frac{\partial^2Y}{\partial \phi^2}
                    +CY = 0.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're not close to the end. In fact, there is much heavy
                    lifting yet to do. In particular, at this stage we need to
                    seperate the angular equation into its constituent parts,
                    and solve those portions. Then we need to solve the radial
                    equation. We start with the angular components. Assuming
                    that $Y(\theta, \phi) = \Theta(\theta) \cdot \Phi(\phi)$,
                    we write
                    $$
                    \frac{\Phi}{\sin \theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}
                    \left(\sin\theta\frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right) + 
                    \frac{\Theta}{\sin^2\theta}\frac{d^2\Phi}{d\phi^2}
                    + C\Phi\Theta = 0.
                    $$
                    In a similar way as we did with the Schrodinger equation, we
                    again multiply by $\sin^2 \theta$ and divide by
                    $\Phi\Theta$. Our new equation is
                    $$
                    \frac{\sin\theta}{\Theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}
                    \left(\sin\theta\frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right) + 
                    \frac{1}{\Phi}\frac{d^2\Phi}{d\phi^2}
                    + C\sin^2\theta = 0.
                    $$
                    Taking a new seperation constant $B$, we have a polar
                    equation and an azimuthal equation:
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & \frac{\sin\theta}{\Theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}
                    \left(\sin\theta\frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right) 
                    + C\sin^2\theta - B= 0,\\
                    \\
                    & \frac{1}{\Phi}\frac{d^2\Phi}{d\phi^2} + B = 0.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                    Now we can begin solving. I'm going to start with the
                    azimuthal portion, because it's the simplest. As anyone who
                    took first year physics should be able to recognize, this is
                    a 2nd order linear ODE with constant coefficients &endash;
                    it has a solution 
                    $$
                    \Phi(\phi) = a_1e^{im\phi}+a_2e^{-im\phi}
                    $$
                    with $B = m^2$. We may choose a coordinate system in which
                    $a_2 = 0$, and do so for simplicity. Something else of
                    interest: we see immediately from this that $m$ has to be
                    integer-valued: if it were not, there would be different
                    values for $\theta = 0$ and $\theta = 2\pi$. We dust off
                    our hands and say the solution to the azimuthal equation is
                    $$
                    \Phi(\phi) = a_1e^{im\phi}.
                    $$
                    Next up is the much more involved polar equation. Deep
                    breaths, we'll get through it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alright. Taking $B=m^2$ again, the polar equation is
                    $$
                    \frac{\sin\theta}{\Theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}
                    \left(\sin\theta\frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right) 
                    + C\sin^2\theta - m^2= 0.
                    $$
                    Rearranging,
                    $$
                    \frac{1}{\sin\theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}
                    \left(\sin\theta\frac{d\Theta}{d\theta}\right) 
                    + \left(C-\frac{m^2}{\sin^2\theta}\right)\Theta = 0.
                    $$
                    Now we do something very clever. We make a substitution:
                    $P(\cos\theta) \equiv \Theta(\theta) , x \equiv \cos\theta$.
                    Our differential changes, now, to
                    $$
                    \frac{d}{d\theta} = \frac{dx}{d\theta}\frac{d}{dx}
                    = -\sin\theta\frac{d}{dx}
                    $$
                    and
                    $$
                    \frac{1}{\sin\theta}(-\sin\theta)\frac{d}{dx}
                    \left(\sin\theta(-\sin\theta\frac{dP}{dx}\right)+
                    \left(C - \frac{m^2}{\sin^2\theta}\right)P = 0.
                    $$
                    We can make this cleaner. This rearranges to
                    $$
                    \frac{d}{dx}\left(\sin^2\theta\frac{dP}{dx}\right)+
                    \left(C-\frac{m^2}{\sin^2\theta}\right)P =0
                    $$
                </p>

                <p>    
                    It turns out that this differential equation has a set of
                    solutions for a given energy $E$, which we index using the
                    "quantum numbers" $n$,$l$, and $m$. We write our solution as
                    $\psi_{n,l,m}(r,\theta,\phi)$.  The first of these quantum
                    numbers parameterizes the allowed values of the second, and
                    the second parameterizes the allowed values of the third:
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    & n = 1,2,3,...,\\
                    \\
                    & l = 0,1,2,...,n-1,\\
                    \\
                    & m = -l, -l +1,...,l.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
