                    The ferromagnetic alignments discussed in chapter 2 of
                    Schroeder's Thermal Physics are a simplification on what is
                    actually some fundamental quantum mechanics. While what is
                    written below is not strictly necessary for understanding
                    the sheer classical thermodynamics in section 1, this
                    subject is important enough on its own to deserve further
                    discussion. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pure, classical paramagnets are systems with particles
                    aligned randomly in the absence of an external field; only
                    becoming alinged after some field is applied to them. We
                    tend to think of the systems as non-self-interacting. In
                    this picture, the alignment of the dipoles are due to a
                    torque being applied to them by the external field &ndash;
                    the dipoles lining up parallel to the field lines. The
                    quantum picture of this alignment is closer to the truth, 
                    and requires greater detail. To understand, we first need
                    to grasp the concepts of angular momentum and spin in a 
                    quantum mechanical setting. We focus on what these terms
                    mean in the setting of the hydrogen atom, but much of what
                    is discussed is adaptable to other settings. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We start with spin. What we call "spin" in quantum mechanics
                    is a property of quantum objects. Spin can be understood as
                    an intrinsic angular momentum fundamentally ascribed to a
                    particle. It can be shown to exist observationally, by
                    recalling the Stern-Gerlach experiment. Crucially, it may
                    also be seen to be a quantized value: the deflection of
                    silver atoms in the inhomogeneous magnetic field causes the
                    particles to cluster in two points. Classically, one would
                    expect a uniform, continuous distribution &ndash; instead,
                    two distinct concentrations of particles are seen. The beam
                    being split in two necessitates that this intrinsic
                    ground-state spin could not be quantized as an integer. If
                    it were, the beam would be split into 3 parts: -1, 0, and 1.
                    It is concluded that the particles in the beam had an
                    intrinsic angular momentum of $\frac{1}{2}$, which is where
                    we get the term "spin-$\frac{1}{2}$". All known fermions
                    have half-integer spins, including the proton and electron
                    that make up the hydrogen atom. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Angular momentum requires some more serious mathematics, and
                    we explore this quantity as it relates to the system energy.
                    We ask what the Schrodinger equation predicts for the
                    stationary orbits of the electron in the hydrogen atom. We
                    get the following:
                    $$
                    \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 \psi 
                    - \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}\psi = E\psi,
                    $$
                    remembering that the potential energy for the orbit of the
                    electron is $\frac{-e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0r}$, and $\mu
                    =\frac{m_em_p}{m_e+m_p}$ is the center of mass between the
                    electron and the proton. We choose to work in spherical
                    coordinates. Now, try not to get discouraged: what I am
                    about to write is the meat and potatoes of what is learned
                    in a second course on quantum theory at the undergraduate
                    level. I will break it down into parts for easier
                    understanding. We take a deep breath and write the
                    Schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom in spherical
                    coordinates now.
                    $$
                    \frac{-\hbar^2}{2 \mu}
                    \left[\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}
                    \left(r^2\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}\right) + 
                    \frac{1}{r^2\sin \theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
                    \left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta}
                    \right) + \frac{1}{r^2\sin^2 \theta}
                    \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial \phi^2} \right] - 
                    \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}\psi = E\psi.
                    $$
                </p>

                <p>    
                    It turns out that this differential equation has a set of
                    solutions for a given energy $E$, which we index using the
                    "quantum numbers" $n$,$l$, and $m$. We write our solution as
                    $\psi_{n,l,m}(r,\theta,\phi)$.  The first of these quantum
                    numbers parameterizes the allowed values of the second, and
                    the second parameterizes the allowed values of the third:
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    n &= 1,2,3,...,\\
                    \\
                    l &= 0,1,2,...,n-1\\
                    \\
                    m &= -l, -l +1,...,l.
                    \end{align}
                    $$
