                    As you've probably heard by now, the long-awaited results of 
                    the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have been 
                    <a href = 'https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205/page/Focus_on_EHT', target=_blank>announced</a>- 
                    and we have for the first time ever imaged the area 
                    directly surrounding a black hole. This is a pretty 
                    astounding result for physics, and is further evidence for 
                    the existence of black holes as more than a mathematical 
                    phenomenon. However, there have been indications of the 
                    existence of black holes for quite some time. There are 
                    scores solutions to the Einstein field equations indicating 
                    their existence. The 
                    <a href ='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/detection-companion-papers', target=_blank>LIGO results</a> 
                    pretty definitively determine the existence of gravitational 
                    waves, at strengths consistent with Einstein's theory 
                    applied to a black hole merger. UCLA's 
                    <a href = 'http://www.astro.ucla.edu/%7Eghezgroup/gc/', target=_blank>Galactic Center Group</a> 
                    under the direction of <a href ='http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~ghez/', target=_blank>Andrea Ghez</a> 
                    performed observations around the center of the Milky Way at 
                    an object referred to as "Sagittarius A*" (and often 
                    abbreviated to Sgr A*) which produced the following image:

                <div class="image">

                <p>
                    This, though, is the first direct image of a black hole's 
                    environment ever constructed, and an very convincing result- 
                    all but confirming the existence of black holes in nature. 
                    Not that there were many doubters left! Here's a look:

                <p>
                    I think this image is pretty fascinating. However there are 
                    a lot of things the interested though untrained eye might 
                    miss, misinterpret, or not understand. I'm going to address 
                    some of the questions the gifted amateur might have: How was 
                    this image made, why is it so blurry, what is that ring 
                    around the shadow, and why is it so uneven?
                </p>

                <p>
                    We'll start with the first question. This image was created 
                    using data collected from 8 different observation stations 
                    in 6 locations in April of 2017. They used a technique 
                    called 
                    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-long-baseline_interferometry', target=_blank>"very long baseline interferometry"</a> 
                    in which signals are combined respecting the time-difference 
                    between receipt of the signals in such a way that emulates a 
                    telescope that is as large as the distance in between the 
                    observing stations. Given the seperation of the telescopes, 
                    and thanks to the Earth's rotation, this has effectively 
                    given the researchers an Earth-sized telescope with an 
                    observational wavelength of 1.3mm (which puts it in the 
                    class of "extremely high frequency" microwaves). The data, 
                    once collected, was flown to the 
                    <a href='https://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/', target=_blank>Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy</a> 
                    in Bonn, Germany and the 
                    <a href ='https://www.haystack.mit.edu/', target=_blank>Haystack Observatory</a> 
                    in Westford, Massachusetts. The daunting quantity of 
                    analysable data needed to be physically transported to these 
                    research stations- there was simply too much to practically 
                    transfer electronically.
                </p>
 
                <p>
                    The data was processed using two sets of algorithms that 
                    account both for the under-constrained circumstances due to 
                    the sparse population of detectors on the globe and for the 
                    lack of optimal phase calibration resulting in some large 
                    uncertainties in amplitude callibration. The first set of 
                    these algorithms are called 
                    "<a href ='http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/1974A%26AS...15..417H', target=_blank>CLEAN</a>" 
                    algorithms, which were first devised by Jan HÃ¶gbom in 1974. 
                    The algorithm finds the strongest signal and convolves it 
                    with a "point-source function", and then reduces the gain 
                    from this convolution from the image. This process acts as 
                    an interative noise-reduction process. The second set of 
                    algorithms used are called "regularized maximum likelyhood" 
                    (RML) algorithms that conform to the observed results, but 
                    try to interpret the data in a way that adhere to certain 
                    desired properties- smooth and compact images being expected 
                    in the case of a black hole. Both research teams (acting 
                    independently to avoid crossover bias) came up with similar 
                    images of an asymmetric ring around a large, dark spot. 
                    This process was repeated along different "pipelines"- 
                    different fabrications of the images using distinct 
                    methodologies.

                <p>
                    The blur is pretty stragihtforawrd to answer- for one thing,
                    there's a small gaussian blurring effect added to each of 
                    the images to account for the differences in angular 
                    resolution across the different pipelines. The image of the
                    black hole above is the average image across all three 
                    pipelines. The main contribution to the blur, however, is 
                    due to the fact that the object being viewed is astoundingly 
                    far away and, while very large by itself, does not compare 
                    in size to its distance from Earth. Even with an effective 
                    telescope diameter the size of the earth, it's very 
                    difficult to get a high-resolution image in the short 
                    timespan in which the data was being collected.
                </p>


                <p>
                    Now why do we see an asymmetric ring around the black hole? 
                    The ring is comprised of plasma and light that has escpaed 
                    from its orbit around the black hole- and warped into a ring 
                    around the black hole's shadow by a process called 
                    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens',target=_blank>gravitational lensing</a>. 
                    The space around the black hole is bent in such a way that 
                    it curves the light around it, bending its trajectory, and 
                    resulting in this ring we observe. But why the asymmetry? 
                    This arises due to the fact that the black hole itself is 
                    rotating- in this case, clockwise! The rotation of the black 
                    hole serves to doppler boost the plasma coming from the side 
                    moving towards the observer, and to doppler dim the plasma 
                    coming from the side moving away from the observer. Pretty 
                    neat, huh? Now, normally this effect would be very small. 
                    We don't typically see this kind of stuff happening about 
                    rotating massive objects in the night sky- the 
                    noticeablility of this effect hinges on the fact that the 
                    rotations are incredibly fast: almost at light speed!
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is an inspiring feat of science, and a testament to 
                    the effectiveness of collective efforts. With an 
                    interdisciplinary team including hundreds of scientists, 
                    engineers, and programmers based in North and South America, 
                    Asia, Africa, and Europe, and with observatories just as far 
                    flung, this project and its staggering results are an 
                    incredible display of the sheer power of international 
                    cooperation.

                <p>
                    On a personal note, I am lucky enough to know some of the 
                    authors. I want to congratulate Professor Avery Broderick, 
                    whose wisdom I was fortunate to benefit from while he was my 
                    instructor in stellar astrophysics in 2015. I also want to 
                    congratulate my friends Chunchong (Rufus) Ni, with whom I 
                    spent many late nights working at the physics building on 
                    Waterloo campus, and Paul Tiede, from whom I have sought 
                    advice and direction more than once. They are some of the 
                    hardest-working people I know. With this, their efforts 
                    have more than paid off.
