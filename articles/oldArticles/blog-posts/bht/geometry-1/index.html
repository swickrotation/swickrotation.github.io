                <h5 id='intro'>3.1 - Introduction</h5>

				<p>
				    If you have made it this far, I am appreciative of your
                    persistance, but I warn you that the following is going to
                    get into some deeper mathematical ideas. I am not going to
                    water down the technicality in this section, though I will
                    try my best to explain the concepts well enough that I
                    won't have to. If you would prefer more expository view of
                    concepts in geometry without the mathematics I have no
                    suggestions. Surely such things exist, it is simply that I
                    trust the reader's conversance with a search engine is as
                    strong as mine.
				</p>

                <p>
                    I am writing this series of notes for two reasons: first,
                    to consolidate some of my own knowledge about black hole
                    thermodynamics and its priors, and secondly as a primer
                    for more developed notes and future lecture material. With
                    these goals in mind, I will elaborate on the approach
                    taken. I am choosing to write a substantial amount on
                    geometry and its prerequisites in this section and the
                    next because my own approach towards black hole
                    thermodynamics has been deeply mathematical. I consider a
                    strong grounding in differential geometry to be critically
                    important for understanding this deeply theoretical field.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are portions of mathematics that I will assume the
                    reader is familiar with. Explicitly, I will assume an
                    understanding of multivariable calculus (including vector
                    calculus), linear algebra, and both ordinary and partial
                    differential equations. I will also assume later (though
                    not in this section) a basic understanding of probability
                    and statistical theory. In these topics I will trust the
                    reader to follow along in calculations without much
                    guidance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will be taking for granted that the reader is capable of
                    learning some basic theory without my assistance. There will
                    be portions of these notes where I name a theorem used but
                    do not elaborate on its development &mdash; there is only
                    so far I can go down the rabbit hole. The branches of
                    mathematics for which this conceit is relevant will be
                    complex analysis and group theory, as well as parts of 
                    topology. We will, however, be making some explicit
                    construction of topology and topological ideas for our
                    grounding in geometry. We begin with this in short order.
                </p>

                <h5 id='topo'>3.2 - Elements of Topology</h5>

                <p>
                    In order to understand topological manifolds, we must
                    understand the structure of topological space. We take the
                    simpler route through open sets rather than the historic
                    neighbourhood approach. The name "open sets" is slightly
                    misleasing and is a historical artifact due to the
                    development of topology as a means towards analytical ends.
                    What we call open sets, in a strict topological setting, are
                    simply elements contained in topological space. It is upon
                    us now to define that space.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>DEFINITION 3.2.1:</b> A <em>Topological Space</em> 
                    $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a set $X$ and a collection of subsets
                    of $X$, $\mathcal{T}$ which satisfy the following three
                    properties:
                    <div class='list'>
                        <ol type='1'>
                            <li>
                                The union of an arbitrary collection of subsets,
                                each members of $\mathcal{T}$, is also open and
                                thus a member of $\mathcal{T}$. This may be
                                written as
                                $$
                                \text{if   } O_{\alpha} \in \mathcal{T} \forall
                                \ \alpha, \  \bigcup_{\alpha} O_{\alpha} \in 
                                \mathcal{T}.
                                $$
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The finite intersection of elements of
                                $\mathcal{T}$ is an element of $\mathcal{T}$.
                                That is,
                                $$
                                \text{for   } O_1 \ldots O_n \in \mathcal{T},\  
                                \bigcap_{i=1}^n O_i \in \mathcal{T}.
                                $$
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The set $X$ and the empty set $\varnothing$ are
                                elements of $\mathcal{T}$.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </p>

                <p>
                    We require a few more notions before moving on to defining
                    topological manifolds. We desire of those objects the
                    following topological properties: that they are 
                    <em>Hausdorff</em> and <em>Second-Countable</em>, and a
                    further non-topolological property discussed later. For now,
                    we state the definitions:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Definition 3.2.2:</b> we call a topological space 
                    <em>Hausdorff</em> if for any distinct elements $p,q\ \in
                    X$, it is possible to find open sets $O_p$, $O_q$ $\in
                    \mathcal{T}$ such that $p \in O_p$, $q \in O_q$, $O_p \cap
                    O_q = \varnothing$.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Definition 3.2.3:</b> we call a topological space 
                    <em>Second-Countable</em> if there is a countable collection
                    of open sets in $X$ such that any open set in $X$ can be
                    expressed as a union of elements in this collection.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The following definition is not necessary for the
                    description of smooth manifolds in themselves, but does fit
                    here as topological preliminary.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Definition 3.2.4:</b> Say $X$ and $Y$ are topological
                    spaces. We say that a transformation $\phi : X \rightarrow
                    Y$ is a <em>homeomorphism</em> if $\phi$ is injective,
                    surjective, continuous, and has continuos inverse.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the context of sheer topology, what is meant by
                    "continuous" is that the inverse image of every open set in
                    $Y$ is an open set in $X$. Put plainly, homeomorphisms
                    uniquely map open sets to open sets between topological
                    spaces.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our last definition before we put these pieces together is
                    as follows:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Definition 3.2.5:</b> we call a topological space
                    <em>locally Euclidean of dimension n</em> if for every
                    element $x \in X$ there exists an open subset of $X$
                    containing $x$, $U$, such that $U$ is homeomorphic to an
                    open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
                </p>

                <h5 id='topman'>3. The Topological Manifold</h5>

                <p>
                    We use the topological notions above to describe one of
                    the most basic objects in geometry.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Definition 3.3.1:</b> a <em>Topological Manifold of
                    dimension n</em> is a topological space that is Hausdorff,
                    second-countable, and locally n-Euclidean. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This most simple manifold will serve as the basis on which
                    we develop the necessary geometry to study general
                    relativity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At this point we've developed some of the tools we need,
                    but without any of the intuition or motivation. We will
                    take a step back now and develop a feel for these tools,
                    and then proceed.
                </p>
