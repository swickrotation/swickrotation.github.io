                    The point of this post is two-fold: First, I've just tried 
                    to implement MathJax in the site, and I'm gonna try to test 
                    it out. If you're seeing this, it probably worked. Secondly, 
                    I've been thinking a lot about conventions in physics, how 
                    they're useful, when they're not, and what we gain by 
                    thinking about them. In a more abstract sense, the line of 
                    thought leads (or at least has lead me) to the unsurprising 
                    but important realization that the order in which learn 
                    things can substantially effect our tastes, and not always 
                    benignly.

                    So I've been taking a course called "Quantum Field Theory 
                    for Cosmology" at Perimeter this semester. It's a spiritual 
                    successor to a course I took the previous semester, which 
                    focused on general relativity. In both of these courses, 
                    we've got this thing called a "metric", which is 
                    essentially a way of telling us how far away certain events 
                    are in spacetime. In Minkowski (flat) spacetime, we've got 
                    two ways of representing the metric. In general relativity 
                    and quantum gravity, the convention is: 
                    $$\eta^{\mu \nu}= \eta_{\mu \nu} =
                    \begin{pmatrix}
                        -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
                    \end{pmatrix}$$
                    and in quantum field theory and particle physics, the 
                    convention is
                    $$\eta^{\mu \nu}= \eta_{\mu \nu}=
                    \begin{pmatrix}
                        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
                    \end{pmatrix} 
                    $$
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's important to note for the non-specialist that these 
                    will give you the same physics, as long as you're consistent 
                    in your choice. I'll give an example: take the Lagrangian 
                    density of a real scalar field- 
                    
                    $$\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}\eta_{\mu \nu}\partial_{\mu}\phi
                    \partial_{\nu}\phi - \frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2$$ 

                    This is going to look a little different depending on our 
                    choice of metric: in the first, it's going to be 
                    
                    $$-\frac{1}{2}\dot{\phi}^2 + \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\phi)^2-
                    \frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2$$ 
                    
                    and in the second, 
                    
                    $$\frac{1}{2}\dot{\phi}^2 - \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\phi)^2-
                    \frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2$$ 
                    Solving the equations of motion,
                    
                    $$\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\phi} = -m^2\phi 
                    \quad , \quad \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(
                    \partial_{\mu}\phi)} = (-\dot{\phi}, \nabla\phi)$$ 
                    
                    Very similarly, in the second metric, 
                    
                    $$\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\phi} = -m^2\phi 
                    \quad , \quad \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(
                    \partial_{\mu}\phi)}  = (\dot{\phi}, -\nabla\phi)$$ 
                    
                    These both lead to very similar Euler-Lagrange equations:
                    
                    $$\ddot{\phi} - \nabla^2\phi+m^2\phi = 0$$ 
                    
                    For the negative signature, or 
                    
                    $$-\ddot{\phi} + \nabla^2\phi+m^2\phi = 0 $$ 
                    
                    for the positive. These both lead to, in relativistic 
                    notation, identical reductions to what is termed the 
                    Klein-Gordon equation: 
                    
                    $$(\partial^{\mu}\partial_{\mu} + m^2)\phi = 0$$ 
                    
                    So they both work. I first learned the first one, and so in 
                    the tribal way that people tend towards, I decided it was 
                    the best way to do things and that the other way wasn't as 
                    good. But they both have their strengths and their 
                    weaknesses, but only really in the aspects that become more 
                    obvious depending on the sign. For the $(+,-,-,-)$ 
                    convention, you get timelike 4-vectors with positive 
                    magnitude. For $(-,+,+,+)$, you keep familiar 3-d 
                    formalism. You also don't have to worry about your 
                    determinant flipping in a generalized dimensionality case. 
                    It's an aesthetic choice, and (as far as I can tell) 
                    nothing deper. I still prefer the first one, but only 
                    because I'm used to it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The point I'm trying to make, and I swear there is one, is 
                    that I've been thinking a lot these past couple of days 
                    about how much of what we learn is stylistic in nature 
                    rather than substantiative, and the interrelation of style 
                    and substance. No serious conclusions yet, but I'm going 
                    to use this example as a reminder to be more open-minded 
                    about ways to frame information, ways of knowing, and ways 
                    of understanding. 
                </p>
