					This week the Swedish Academy announced the Nobel Prize for 
                    Physics, and I saw a familiar name on the list- Waterloo's 
                    own Professor Donna Strickland! I learned of the news waking 
                    up to scads of messages from friends and family asking if I 
                    knew the professor. In fact, I had worked in a lab connected 
                    to hers as a freshman, and learned how to do chirped pulse 
                    amplification right next door to the technique's inventor.

                    The prizes this year were alotted for inventions of new 
                    optical techniques. 
                    <a href='https://www.osa.org/en-us/history/biographies/arthur-ashkin/'>Arthur Ashkin</a> 
                    took half of the prize, for his invention of "optical 
                    tweezers", a technique for extremely fine manipulation and 
                    stabilisation of micrometer-scale objects with light that 
                    relies on the strong gradient in electric field at the 
                    narrowest portion of a laser beam. A dielectric particle is 
                    attracted to this beam waist, but then displaced slightly 
                    from the impact of absorbed and scattered photons. In the 
                    event of the beam's displacement from the center, the 
                    greater momentum change imparted by the more intense portion 
                    of the beam causes the particle to readjust towards the 
                    beams center due to Newton's 3rd law.

                <p>
                    This process is pretty cool and has a ton of applications, 
                    most notably in biological sciences for isolating particular 
                    portions of DNA sequences and interacting them with 
                    different kinds of proteins.

                    The part of the prize this year with which I am more 
                    familiar is the work due to 
                    <a href='https://cuos.engin.umich.edu/researchgroups/hfs/profiles/gerard-mourou/'>GÃ©rard Mourou</a> 
                    and 
                    <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/people-profiles/donna-strickland'>Donna Strickland</a> 
                    on a process called "chirped pulse amplification" (often CPA 
                    for short). Chirped pulse amplification is a process by 
                    which a comparatively weak, comparatively long pulse of 
                    light is split up into its constituent wavelengths, 
                    amplified, and recombined to make a comparatively strong, 
                    comparatively short pulse. Developed by these two 
                    reaserchers during the 1980's at the University of 
                    Rochester, the process is roughly as follows:
                </p>

                <p>
                    First, the long pulse is fired at a diffraction grating 
                    which splits the beam into its constituent wavelengths. The 
                    Planck equation gives us $$E = h\nu = \frac{h\lambda}{c},$$ 
                    so each chirped pulse has energy $E_i$ corresponding to 
                    wavelength $\lambda_i$. By sending parts of the beam with 
                    different energies along different courses- each of 
                    different length, the beam is seperated into portions, each 
                    having fairly low energy. This process is called "chirping". 
                    These chirped pulses are then sent through a beam amplifier 
                    which bounces the beam on top of itself multiple times: 
                    shortening the pulse length, and greatly increasing its 
                    amplitude and thus its power. Those amplified beams are then 
                    recombined by sending them through diffraction gratings with 
                    the opposite index as those they were split with. These new, 
                    recombined pulses are ultrashort and much more powerful than 
                    a direct beam-to-amplifier pulse could be. 
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Why is that the case? The simple answer is that the 
                    amplifiers can't handle beams past a certain energy 
                    threshold: they themselves would melt due to the large 
                    energies involved. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I liked learning this process a lot, mostly because it's a 
                    simple technique to implement and to understand (even as a 
                    freshman physics major!) but it's a powerful technique that 
                    greatly expands the capabilities of what is possible even 
                    with a fairly weak optical source.That meant that, 
                    practically overnight, the number of laser laboratories 
                    capable of doing novel research increased dramatically- and 
                    it made deep inroads into the field of femtosecond laser 
                    research in its own right!
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I woke up to the news and heard that a member of our 
                    department had been awarded the prize, Dr. Strickland was 
                    the first person who came to mind. She's been a big deal in 
                    optics since the invention of CPA, and this well-deserved 
                    award has been a long time coming.
