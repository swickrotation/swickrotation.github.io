					<h1>A Primer on Quantum Computing: Quantum teleportation</h1>
                    <h4>July, 2018</h4>

					<p>
						Thursday last I gave a really fast primer on quantum 
                        mechanics (with an eye towards quantum computing) for 
                        the university's computer science club. Computer science 
                        majors are a technically inclined audience, but (at 
                        least at Waterloo) have no mandatory training in 
                        fundamental physics. This perspective lays an 
                        interesting challenge! How do you motivate a field for 
                        an audience with a wholly different set of interests? I 
                        tried starting with the mathematics as a common 
                        foundation, thinking that this would lead to a more 
                        accessible entry-what I found instead was that letting 
                        the students ask questions about the physics, they 
                        managed to get the principles more clearly!
					</p>
			
					<p>
						I'm gonna write out the essence of the talk here. It's 
                        pretty entry-level stuff, I think you could find most of 
                        what I laid out in the first two chapters of Nielsen and 
                        Chuang. I focused on two physical properties of 
                        quantum states and their interactions- superposition and 
                        entanglement. Both of these properties yield interesting 
                        results when you apply them to problems that are 
                        computational in nature!
					</p>

					<p>
						First up is to talk superposition: Superposition is a 
                        fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. That is to 
                        say, it is an observed phenomena that two quantum states 
                        can be "overlaid" in a way to create a new state, in a 
                        way quite analogous to the way macroscopic waves 
                        overlay- the associated constructive and destructive 
                        interference included. In fact, the mathematical 
                        representations of dynamics of quantum systems are 
                        wavelike in nature, reflecting this. We call the 
                        principle of superposition one of the "postulates" of 
                        quantum mechanics. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						In a mathematical way, we need to talk about the way 
                        that a quantum state "exists" mathematically speaking. 
                        We express quantum mechanical systems and states as 
                        elements (generally vectors) of a multi-dimensional 
                        (even infinitely dimensional), complex-valued 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space" target="_blank">"Hilbert Space"</a>. 
                        We take that the basis of this Hilbert space is 
                        orthonormal for a few reasons- firstly, in quantum 
                        mechanics, we cannot distinguish between the 
                        measurement outcomes of non-orthogonal systems 
                        reliably. Picking an orthogonal basis in which to 
                        operate makes the construction of reliably measurable 
                        states simpler. It also has the added benefit of 
                        making many of our calculations very simple- if you're 
                        taking the inner product between any two non-equal 
                        elements, it's just zero! As for normality, we use 
                        normalized vectors so that we can keep our notions and 
                        parallels with probabilistic results, and normality 
                        conditions lead to natural weightings on expected 
                        measurement results. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Concretely, taking some state 
                        
                        $$\ket{\psi} = \alpha\ket{0}+\beta\ket{1}$$ 
                        
                        $$\alpha^2+\beta^2 = 1$$ 
                        
                        and realizing that in our "computational basis" our 
                        vectors are represented as 
                        
                        $$\ket{0} = 
							\begin{pmatrix} 
								1 \\
								0\\
							\end{pmatrix}, \, 
						\ket{1} = 
							\begin{pmatrix} 
								0 \\ 
								1 \\ 
						\end{pmatrix}$$

						we see that the state $\ket{\psi}$ is in fact normal 
                        upon the evaluation of the inner product. We say that 
                        $\ket{\psi}$ is in a "superposition" of $\ket{0}$ and 
                        $\ket{1}$, as it's a linear combination of the two 
                        basis parameters. This is in clear analog of classical 
                        superpositions of waves, their waiting, and their 
                        position in space. A lot of the advantage that we're a
                        vailed in quantum computing comes from the idea that 
                        the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are allowed to take 
                        any complex values, so long as they fulfill the above 
                        condition. The way That a collapse of a superposition 
                        happens is with a "measurement"- which essentially 
                        selects either of the states with a probability of the 
                        squares of their respective coefficients. This is 
                        reflected in 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule", target = "_blank">Born's Rule</a> 
                        and expressed mathematically with the explanation that 
                        quantum state vectors may be represented as belonging 
                        to the space $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ with a Lebesgue measure 
                        of 1. The probability amplitudes of each potential 
                        result may be found to be 
                        
                        $$c_n^2$$ 
                        
                        with 
                        
                        $$c_n = \braket{\psi_n}{\phi_n} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\psi^{*}_{n}\phi_{n}dx.$$ 
                        
                        Again, making sure that the normality condition is 
                        held. Effectively, we should be finding results saying
                        the probability of measuring a certain outcome is the 
                        square of the coefficient associated with that state- 
                        though this may change after particular operations on 
                        our state vector.

						Next stop on our road to understanding in entanglement. 
                        Entanglement is a feature of quantum mechanics that 
                        has a reputation for being fairly unintuitive- not the 
                        least reason for this being that associated terms lend 
                        to the incorrect notion that entangled particles allow 
                        superluminal communication- which is a very big problem 
                        if you believe our dear friend Professor Einstein. At 
                        it's core, entanglement is an induced relationship 
                        between certain observable parameters of quantum 
                        systems- spin and polarization requiring special mention 
                        as the "canonical" examples. What plagued the physics 
                        community in the late 1930's was the indication that 
                        entangled states violated a principle called "local 
                        realism" which was a long-standing notion of classical 
                        mechanics. This violation is what Einstein, as well as 
                        his collaborators Podolsky and Rosen, had the most 
                        trouble accepting. However, it was shown experimentally 
                        that entangled states do in fact violate local realism, 
                        more or less putting the argument to rest. The result of 
                        decoherence is known immediately by the states in 
                        question, though the knowledge of the result is not. 
                        There is no violation of special relativity, despite 
                        what the terminology would lead the naive to think.

						In mathematical terms, lets say we have two state 
                        vectors from two different Hilbert spaces, 
                        $\mathcal{H}_a$ and $\mathcal{H}_b$.  Then the 
                        interaction of these two states is going to exist in 
                        the "product space" 
                        
                        $$\mathcal{H}_a \otimes \mathcal{H}_b.$$ 
                        
                        Now, some vectors may exist in this product space that 
                        may be written out simply as kronecker products between 
                        vectors from each state themselves, say 
                        
                        $$\ket{\phi_a}\otimes\ket{\psi_b}.$$ 
                        
                        We call states like these "separable", and they are not 
                        entangled. However, there are plenty of new state 
                        vectors that do exist in the product space and are not 
                        separable. For example, the state 
                        
                        $$\frac{\ket{0}_a\ket{0}_b+\ket{1}_a\ket{1}_b}{\sqrt{2}}$$ 
                        
                        is not separable, but surely exists in some product 
                        state. We call these states entangled because it is 
                        impossible to say which part of the state came from 
                        what Hilbert space. These entangled may be measured 
                        partially such that you learn both results without 
                        having to measure both states individually- in the 
                        above example, if Alice measures her state to be 0, 
                        we know Bob's state is also 0. Entanglement doesn't 
                        last forever, though- once the entangled states are 
                        measured, they decohere and are no longer correlated. 
					</p>

					<p>
						So what does any of this physics stuff have to do with 
                        computing? It turns out that there are some algorithms 
                        that, if implemented on the appropriate hardware, 
                        produce a significant speed-up over classical methods 
                        of computing when using these properties! 
					</p>

					<p>
						Personally, I find that "quantum teleportation" is an 
                        algorithm that is sufficiently simple to explain to the 
                        interested layperson, but with a result interesting 
                        enough and understandable enough to be appreciated. 
                        Let's dive in!
					</p>

					<p>
						First, it is important to make explicit our vernacular. 
                        A "qubit" is most easily understood in the same way a 
                        classical bit is, but with the ability to conform to 
                        the conventions of quantum mechanics. Most intuitively, 
                        a single qubit is a two-level system which may exist in 
                        superposition but must collapse into one of its 
                        mutually-exclusive states: $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$. 
                        There are many different models for the physical 
                        realization of a qubit, and to list and explain them 
                        would be a post all to itself (and frankly a little 
                        outside my particular area of interest at the moment). 
                        You can put a bunch of qubits together, and you can 
                        entangle them with each other. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Now lets set the scene. Let us suppose that Alice and 
                        Bob are an adventuring duo who share a mutual interest 
                        in information theory. Sometime before the events of 
                        today's adventure, they decided to, as good enthusiasts, 
                        prepare a bell state and share it. For simplicity, say 
                        they chose the state 
                        
                        $$\ket{\beta_{00}}=\frac{\ket{0}_a\ket{0}_b+\ket{1}_a\ket{1}_b}{\sqrt{2}}.$$ 
                        
                        Now say, in the course of their adventuring, that they 
                        get separated. For reasons of emotional engagement and 
                        authorial laziness, it is absolutely necessary that 
                        Alice be able to get a particular quantum state, 
                        $\ket{a}=\alpha\ket{0}+\beta\ket{1}$, to Bob lest they 
                        suffer an absurd level of dismay at the hands of some 
                        nefarious entity. The only tool they have to save the 
                        day is their knowledge of quantum mechanics and a few 
                        bits of classical information (like a phone call or 
                        something). 
					</p>

					<p>
						Now, the odds look pretty bad. They can't physically 
                        meet, and they can only share classical bits. But due 
                        to the nature of superposition, there's literally an 
                        infinite amount of information that would need to be 
                        shared between the two to fully characterie the quantum 
                        state (say if alpha/beta are irrational numbers). 
                        Not only that, but they only have a single qubit to 
                        share! Can they do it?  
					</p>

					<p>
						You better believe it. Here's the scheme -

                    <p>
						In this diagram, $q_1$ and  $q_2$ will be the entangled
                        qubits making up the bell state, the former belonging
                        to Alice and the latter to Bob. Word to the wise:
                        circuit diagrams are read from left to right and
                        top-down, but the operations performed by the gates
                        are still applied on the left of the input bits unless
                        otherwise specified.  </p> 
					<p>
						Alice starts by interacting $q_0$ with her half of 
                        the entangled pair: this results in 
                        
                        $$
                        \ket{\psi_0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\biggl[\alpha

						The next operation is a controlled-not: The data 
                        register of the first qubit is read in. If it is equal 
                        to one, it flips the bit on the second line, in this 
                        case. We get 
                        
                        $$

						Next up is a <i>Hadamard gate</i>, being applied on 
                        the first qubit. The Hadamard (in two dimensions) gate 
                        takes the form

						$$
                        H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
						\begin{pmatrix}
						1 & 1 \\
						1 & -1 \\
						\end{pmatrix}
						$$ 
						
                        and when applied to the first qubit yields 
                        
                        $$
                        \ket{\psi_2} = \frac{1}{2}\biggl[\alpha

                        can re-arrange this result after distributing all the
                        products. This recovers

						As we can see, each of Bob's possible qubits 
                        corresponds to one of Alice's measurement results. 
                        Alice must measure her qubit, and tell Bob what she 
                        recovered.
						If she gets $\ket{00}$, Bob needs not send his qubit 
                        through post-processing as it is already in the 
                        original state $\ket{a}$. 
                        However, should she measure another result, say 
                        $\ket{01}$, then Bob must put his qubit through a 
                        "NOT" gate or $X$-gate, which flips the bits, and is 
                        represented by
						
                        $$ X = 
						\begin{pmatrix} 
						0 & 1 \\ 
						1 & 0 \\ 
						\end{pmatrix} 
						$$

						Similarly, if Alice measures $\ket{10}$, Bob must use 
                        a $Z$-gate to flip the sign of the second qubit:
						
                        $$ Z = 
						\begin{pmatrix} 
						1 & 0 \\ 
						0 & -1 \\ 
						\end{pmatrix}.
                        $$
						
						And finally, if Alice recovers $\ket{11}$, Bob must 
                        first apply an $X$-gate and then a $Z$-gate. The 
                        mission was a success!

						But quantum algorithms can do some more practical, 
                        more real-life things as well, some of which are 
                        cause for concern. 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor's_algorithm" , target="_blank">Shor's Algorithm</a> 
                        for example has the power to factor large products of 
                        prime numbers efficiently: a hard task on a classical 
                        computer, and a threat to common internet protocol 
                        encryption schemes. But it's supposed that there will 
                        be algorithms that can things for good, like running 
                        pharmacokinetic simulations to develop better drugs, 
                        or to do complicated protein folding problems and help 
                        physicians cure diseases. It's hard to say what will 
                        happen, or if the tech will really go anywhere, but 
                        it's pretty exciting just to be around researchers 
                        with such drive and energy, and such a young field in 
                        general.
