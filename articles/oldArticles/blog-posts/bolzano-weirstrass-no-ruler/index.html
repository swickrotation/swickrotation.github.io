                <p> 
                    The 
                    <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolzano%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem, target="_blank"> Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem</a> 
                    is often thought of as a critical piece of elementary 
                    education in real analysis. While its criticality is not up 
                    for debate, at least with me, its position as a theorem of 
                    real analysis certainly is! In fact, it is possible to 
                    derive the theorem by shear topological methods, and with a 
                    little help from a base idea of functional analysis- no 
                    metric required. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ordinarily, the theorem is stated as the result that a 
                    sequence is compact (read: 
                    <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequentially_compact_space target="_blank">sequentially compact</a>) 
                    iff it is closed and bounded. This, however, is not an 
                    appropriate statement on a generalized topological space 
                    which, while closed in many cases, does not offer a solid 
                    interpretation of boundedness (in particular, there is no 
                    concept of a "ball" in a general topological space, just 
                    neighbourhoods- which may be infinite). That means we're 
                    going to have to get a little creative. An alternative 
                    formulation to the above is the following, as presented in 
                    Wald's <i>General Relativity</i>:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Theorem: Balzano-Weierstrass - </b> <i>Let 
                        $(X, \mathscr{T})$ be a topological space and let 
                        $A \subset X$. If $A$ is compact, then every sequence 
                        $\{x_n\}$ of points in $A$ has an accumulation point 
                        lying in $A$. Conversely, if $(X, \mathscr{T})$ is 
                        second-countable, and every sequence in $A$ has an 
                        accumulation point in $A$, then $A$ is compact. Thus, 
                        if $(X, \mathscr{T})$ is second-countable, $A$ is 
                        compact if and only if every sequence in $A$ has a 
                        convergent subsequence whose limit lies in $A$.</i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the uninitiated, there's quite a lot to unpack here. 
                    There are handy resources online for learning what all of 
                    these terms mean, and I encourage the reader to read those 
                    if they seek great detail. I will go over some of these 
                    definitions in brief. I am going to assume a passing 
                    familiarity with topology, and thus a pre-existing 
                    understanding of compactness and the properties of 
                    topological spaces. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We call a point $y$ an <i>accumulation point</i> or 
                    <i>limit point</i> of a sequence $\{x_n\}$ if any 
                    neighbourhood of $y$ contains an infinite number of points 
                    contained in $\{x_n\}$. As every neighbourhood of the limit 
                    itself contains the limit, the limit is automatically an 
                    accumulation point. It is not guaranteed in general that 
                    every accumulation point $y$ has a subsequence $\{y_n\}$ of 
                    $\{x_n\}$ such that $\{y_n\}$ converges to $y$, though it is 
                    possible if the space where these sequences lie is 
                    <i>first-countable</i>, which we define below.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    A topological space $(X, \mathscr{T})$ is called 
                    <i>second-countable</i> if every open set in $X$ is 
                    expressible as a union of open sets from some countable set 
                    of open sets. i.e. where $A$, $\mathcal{O}_\alpha$ are open 
                    sets, $$ \forall A \subset X, A = \bigcup\limits_\alpha \mathcal{O}_\alpha$$ 
                    In this way, it is easy to see that second-countability 
                    implies first-countability, which is the notion that every 
                    point in $X$ is contained in at least one of a countable 
                    collection of open sets. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    With the bookkeeping out of the way, we get to the proof of 
                    the theorem.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>PROOF:</b> we start in the forward direction: if $A$ is
                    compact, then the sequences $\{x_n\}$ in $A$ have
                    accumulation points in $A$. The definition of compactness
                    of a set is that any open covering of that set must admit
                    a finite subcovering. We attempt a proof by contradicton,
                    in that we start with a comapct set set in which the
                    seqeunces do not have accumulation points in the set. It
                    is our hope that this leads to a regime in which $A$
                    cannot be compact, thus invalidating the assumption. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    For each $a \in A$, we choose an open set $\ \mathcal{U}_a$ 
                    containing $a$ such that a sequence $\{x_n\}$ contains a 
                    finite amount of points in $\ \mathcal{U}_a$.
                    $\{\mathcal{U}_a | a \in A \}$ is an open cover of $A$,
                    namely the set $\{ \mathcal{U}_{a_1}, \ldots ,
                    \mathcal{U}_{a_n} \}$.  However, if $\{ \mathcal{U}_{a_1},
                    \ldots , \mathcal{U}_{a_n} \}$ is an open cover, $\{x_n \}
                    \subset \{ \mathcal{U}_{a_1}, \ldots , \mathcal{U}_{a_n}
                    \}$.  Then some $\mathcal{U}_{a_i}\}$ in $\{
                    \mathcal{U}_{a_1}, \ldots , \mathcal{U}_{a_n} \}$ contains
                    infinitely many points of $\{x_n\}$  as the sequence
                    $\{x_n\}$ is infinite. A contradiction! If there are to be
                    finitely many sets covering $A$, these sets must contain
                    accumulation points.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Ok, so that's step one. The second step is considerably more 
                    involved. We aim to prove that if $(X,\mathscr{T})$ is 
                    2nd-countable, and if every sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $A$ has an 
                    accumulation point in $A$, that $A$ is compact. This will be 
                    done directly, though we will invoke an idea from a 
                    hitherto-unused part of mathematics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First- if  $(X,\mathscr{T})$ is 2nd-countable, it is first 
                    countable and that guarantees that every convergent sequence 
                    in  $(X,\mathscr{T})$ has convergent subsequences- i.e. 
                    every accumulation point $y$ of a sequence $\{x_n\}$ may be 
                    written as the limit of a sequence $\{y_n\}$ such that 
                    $\{y_n\} \subset  \{x_n\}$. Thus for what it's worth, we can 
                    say that the set $A$ is closed, as $A = \overline{A}$. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now we need the concept of "nets", from functional analysis.
                    A "net" is a function taking a "directional set" to a 
                    topological space. A directional set is a set with an 
                    implicit ordering, like the integers. As an example case, we
                    say $A$ is a set with an index set on the elements of $A$, 
                    $\{n,n-1,\ldots,1\}$, such that elements follow the relation
                    according to their index: 
                    $a_n \geq a_{n-1} \geq \ldots \geq a_1$. That is, in plain
                    english, the last element is greater than or equal to the 
                    second-last, and so-on until you reach the terminal element,
                    if applicable. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Say a net $\{X_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ has a 
                    "cluster point" $x$ if for every neighbourhood $\mathcal{O}$ 
                    of $X$ the index set 
                    $\{\lambda : X_{\lambda} \in \mathcal{O}\}$ is cofinal in 
                    $\Lambda$. $x$ is a cluster point of the net 
                    $\{X_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ iff some subset 
                    $\{X_{\gamma}\}_{\gamma \in \Gamma}$ converges to $x$. $x$ 
                    is an accumulation point of $A$ iff $\exists$ a net 
                    $X \notin \{X_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda} \subset A$ 
                    that converges to $x$. $x \in X$ is an accumulation point of 
                    $A$ if $\mathcal{O}(x)$ contains infinitely many limit 
                    points. We have a lemma to prove:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Lemma:</b> <i>$A \subset X$ is countably compact iff 
                    every infinite subset has a limit point iff every sequence 
                    has a cluster point.</i> 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>PROOF:</b>We start with the last point &mdash; let $K$
                    be an infinite set, and suppose every sequence has a
                    cluster point. Clearly, we may construct a sequence in $K$
                    such that its cluster point is a limit point in $K$. Now
                    on the other hand, suppose that any infinite subset has an
                    accumulation point.  We take some infinite subset $k \in
                    K$ : consider any distinct sequence $\{x_n\}$ with
                    distinct elements. Any of these elements is a cluster point. 
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    Now suppose $X$ is compact. Let $\{x_n\}$ be a sequence in 
                    $X$ and say $B_n = \overline{\{x_i\}}_{i=n}^{\infty}$ so 
                    that $\exists x \in \cap_{n=1}^{\infty}B_n$. Any 
                    neighbourhood of $x$, say $\mathcal{O}$, intersects 
                    infinitely many points of  $\{x_n\}$ as otherwise 
                    $\cap_{n=1}^{\infty}B_n = \emptyset$. On the other hand, 
                    suppose every sequence has a cluster point, and let $B_n$ be 
                    a sequence of closed sets such that they satisfy the 
                    property of finite intersections. We choose any 
                    $x_n \in B_1 \cap \ldots \cap B_n$. Any cluster point of 
                    $\{x_n\}$, like $x$, is therefore in
                    $\cap_{n=1}^{\infty}B_n$.
                    <span style="float:right;">
                        $\blacksquare$
                    </span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    From our construction, we know that countable compactness 
                    implies limit point compactness, and due to 
                    first-countability, vice-versa. Due to second-countability, 
                    we know that every open covering must be made up of a 
                    countable union of open sets from some countable set of open 
                    sets- thus countable compactness implies compactness. This 
                    only works because our space is countable! Were it not for 
                    that fact, one might take some uncountable open covering of 
                    $X$ which would admit no finite subcovering. This 
                    acknowledgement concludes the proof.
