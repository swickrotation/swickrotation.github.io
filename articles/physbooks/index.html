                    <h3 id = "clasmech"><u>Classical Mechanics</u></h3>
			        <h5><i>Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems</i>, J. Marion & S. Thornton</h5>
					<p>
                        This textbook is really junk. Unfortunately, it's 
                        found itself a little niche in the physics 
                        curriculum because it's one of the few (and easily the 
                        most popular) book written for the level of study 
                        you'll probably be at by the time you take your first 
                        "real" (non-introductory level) courses on classical 
                        mechanics. At Waterloo, the AMATH department uses 
                        Taylor's <i>Classical Mechanics</i>, which I hear (but 
                        have not confirmed) is a superior text.
					</p>

					<p>
                        Don't get me wrong, M&T has everything you need per se, 
                        but it gets lost in itself with clumsy formalism. It 
                        attempts to be a more mathematical view of classical 
                        mechanics without the elegance it could avail itself 
                        of in so-doing. If at all possible, steer clear.
					</p>

				    <h5><i>A Course of Theoretical Physics Vol. I: Mechanics</i>, L. Landau & E. Lifshitz</h5>
					<p>
                        This is arguably one of the most beautiful physics books 
                        I've ever read, but it is absolutely not for the faint 
                        of heart. Landau takes no prisoners when it comes to 
                        exposition: by page three, he's already derived the 
                        Euler-Lagrange equation. Do not use this as a first 
                        text- instead, save it for when you understand the 
                        field better. You'll see just how brilliant it is then.
					</p>

				    <h5><i>Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics</i>, V. I. Arnold</h5>
					<p>
                        This one, with Goldstein, have the reputations as the 
                        strongest treatment of classical mechanics at the 
                        graduate level. Arnold has written this text with the 
                        mathematician in mind, so be prepared for some 
                        differential geometry- I'm talking tangent spaces, 
                        vector bundles, manifolds, symplectic spaces, the 
                        works. However, this will get you prepared to talk 
                        general relativity, and apparently gauge theories, 
                        so take it in the teeth. You'll be happy you did.
					</p>

                    <h3 id="electro"><u>Electrodynamics</u></h3>
				    <h5><i>Introduction to Electrodynamics</i>, D. J. Griffiths</h5>
					<p>
                        Without a doubt, this is the strongest of Griffith's 
                        three texts. It's a decent, intermediate text that's 
                        fairly self-contained. Like all of his books, he's a 
                        little wordy, but in a field that's as mathematically 
                        nit-picky as electrodynamics, you'll appreciate the 
                        exposition for this first text. It's also pretty well 
                        the universal undergraduate textbook in this field, and 
                        you'll use it for all three courses if you're at UW. I 
                        actually recommend buying this one, you'll probably 
                        keep it after you graduate.
					</p>

    				<h5><i>Classical Electrodynamics</i>, D. Jackson</h5>
					<p> 
                        This book deserves its reputation. It's the grand-daddy 
                        of all modern texts on electrodynamics and pulls 
                        absolutely no punches when it comes to detail. It is a 
                        cornerstone of graduate education in electrodynamics and 
                        has been for decades. It is probable, that out of any 
                        texts, this is the one your professors have all pored 
                        over - some with more fond memories than others. 
                        Jackson is careful to do his mathematics properly, which 
                        I discovered in particular by seeing the changes between 
                        editions. Hard problems, many hours of work await. But 
                        you'll know E&M if you can hack it.  
					</p>

                    <h3 id="quantum"><u>Quantum Mechanics</u></h3>
		    		<h5><i>Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</i>, D. J. Griffiths</h5>
					<p>
                        I personally don't like the approach taken in this text. 
                        It's a little clunky, just laying the Schrodinger 
                        equation on you on the first page. The philosophy of 
                        the book is to "shut up and calculate", which is fine 
                        for someone who wants to do well on their finals but 
                        doesn't care about how the theory is developed. I don't 
                        mean to knock the book, it's just not what I'd pick up 
                        if I had a choice. The treatment of the hydrogen atom in 
                        chapter 4 was pretty solid, as long as you remember 
                        special functions pretty well. I just wouldn't trust the 
                        text as a referrence for long-term use. I traded my 
                        copy to a friend for his copy of Wald's <i>General 
                        Relativity</i>, and haven't looked back.
					</p>

			    	<h5><i>Modern Quantum Mechanics</i>, J. J. Sakurai, J. Napolitano</h5>
					<p>
                        This is the standard amongst first year graduate 
                        students taking courses in quantum mechanics. In truth, 
                        I haven't read this book all-the-way through, but what 
                        I've read so far is solid. The main author, Sakurai, 
                        died before finishing the book, and apparently this 
                        caused the last two chapters to suffer. The only 
                        complaint that I can bring to bare on the text thus 
                        far is that Sakurai skips many steps, and that makes 
                        following his arguments rather painful at times. I can 
                        understand trying to cut down to make your arguments 
                        elegant, but at times I've had to take up a board to 
                        understand some things that Sakurai simply writes in a 
                        line. Anyway, the "modern" part is really apt- Sakurai 
                        organizes the entire text around symmetry principles and 
                        infinitessimal generators. Also, Sakurai himself only 
                        wrote the first 10 chapters- he died before finishing 
                        the second edition of the text, and Jim Napolitano 
                        finished the book. The quality drops off there- but by 
                        the time you get to the end of the book, there are 
                        better texts covering that material anyway.

                    <h3 id="statmech"><u>Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics</u></h3>
                    <h5><i>Introduction to Thermal Physics</i>, Daniel V. Schroeder</h5>
					<p>
                        I have not come across an introductiory thermodynamics 
                        textbook that has left me satisfied, but Schroeder 
                        comes the closest. It's fairly comprehensive in material 
                        with plenty of applications, and when it doesn't cover a 
                        topic, the author generally points out resources for 
                        supplementary study. To its credit, it has plenty of 
                        problems with a wide range of approaches- some 
                        practical and involving physical participation of the 
                        reader with some equipment, and some more theoretically 
                        grounded questions illustrating links between 
                        thermodynamics and other fields of physics. Where I lose 
                        patience with it is the fairly sloppy notation used 
                        throughout the text- in particular with the fast and 
                        loose use of infinitessimals, and how Schroeder seems to 
                        pick and choose when to call things infinitessimal and 
                        when not to. It gets easier to manage as the reader 
                        progresses, but the result is extra work on the 
                        reader's part without actually gaining extra 
                        understanding. I think the first 4 chapters are about 
                        sufficient for a first course in thermal physics- and 
                        when they're finished, I think the reader may as well 
                        move on to a textbook in straight-up statistical 
                        mechanics. But if you're looking for a primer text with 
                        plenty of decent practice problems written in a more 
                        vernacular style, you're not going to do better with any 
                        other modern text. 
					</p>

                    <h3 id="gr"><u>General Relativity</u></h3>
				    <h5><i>General Relativity</i>, R. Wald</h5>
					<p>
                        As far as self-contained texts on the subject go, I 
                        think this one's the top. It starts from the very 
                        foundations of general relativity, differential 
                        geometry. Starting in chapter two with the first 
                        notions of abstract coordinate spaces, vectors and 
                        one-forms, and coordinate transformations on manifolds. 
                        You'll also learn some things about tensor fields. 
                        After that it's curvature, derivatives, tangent space, 
                        and geodesics. Only after covering these topics do you 
                        get to start doing the physics- but once you do, it 
                        evolves very naturally. This text isn't superfluous or 
                        lost in mathematical detail, but it is precise and 
                        concrete enough that any reader with mathematical 
                        inclinations will not be lost in how loose physicists 
                        usually write. The caveat is, that for a text as long as 
                        it is, it's lacking worked examples that one would 
                        expect- a disadvantage that is particularly difficult to 
                        deal with if the text is indeed your first introduction 
                        to the mathematics involved. It is my opinion that this 
                        can be mitigated with a solid differential gemoetry 
                        text. See Lee's <i>Introduction to Smooth Manifolds</i>
					</p>

                    <h3 id="electro"><u>Quantum Information</u></h3>
    				<h5><i>An Introduction to Quantum Computing</i>, P. Kaye, R. LaFlamme, M. Mosca</h5>
					<p>
                        This book gets a bit of a bad rap, for some reasons 
                        that are pretty fair, but for some other reasons that 
                        are not-so-fair. It was designed essentially as a 
                        compillation of the lecture notes and supplementary 
                        information for PHYS 467 / CS 467 / CO 481, which is a 
                        pretty difficult course to teach. With so many students 
                        coming from these disperate backgrounds, it's really 
                        hard to flesh out each concept in total detail. KLM 
                        doesn't really try to do that. Rather, it offers a 
                        light introduction with the major points exposed and 
                        explained (though in the case of theorems, unproved). 
                        In this regard, it's actually fairly well-contained in 
                        my opinion, as a supplement to the lecture material, 
                        and to other texts and papers. The exercises are 
                        decently well-spaced and reflective of what you'd see 
                        on assignments and teach you some necessary skills and 
                        techniques. The flaw is to think of the text as totally 
                        sufficient on its own to understand the material. This 
                        is due to both the noted lightness of the exposition, 
                        as well as some unfortunate errors in the text itself. 
                        It will likely be well-revised for the next edition. 
					</p>

	    			<h5><i>Quantum Computation and Quantum Information</i>, M. Nielsen, I. Chuang</h5>
					<p>
                        Nielsen and Chuang's textbook is often referred to in a 
                        biblical sense. It's a solid, absolutely comprehensive 
                        introductory text on QI/QC with enough background 
                        material that it could be handed to a talented 
                        sophmore and with enough time an effort, they could 
                        most likely start reading research papers without 
                        having to do too much outside consulting. I used this 
                        text's chapter 7 as a major source when taking PHYS 
                        468 - the discussion of physical quantum computers was 
                        gentle enough that even your most abstract theorist 
                        won't be too lost. Chapters 8, 11, and 12 were major 
                        sources for my final paper for PHYS 467, which was on 
                        concentration of partially entangled bits. It's a 
                        quality book, with a place on the bookshelf of any 
                        aspiring quantum information theorist.
