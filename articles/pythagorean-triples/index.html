						A lot of the reason I read a particular textbook has to 
                        do with its portability. I've got a lot of moving 
                        around to do over the course of the day. If I want to 
                        kill the commute time, reading has always been my 
                        go-to. Reading on the bus is kinda nice, but if you've 
                        got a text that's a little too large, it can be 
                        prohibitive. Not to mention the fact that you've got 
                        to carry it around all day. Fortunately, there are a 
                        plentitude of texts that fit <i>right in your pocket!
                        </i> The one I picked off the shelf today is called 
                        <i>Introduction to Elliptic Curves and Modular 
                        Forms</i>, by a guy named Neal Koblitz. He's a 
                        cryptographer at the university of Washington, and an 
                        adjunct faculty member here at Waterloo.

						I don't actually know any number theory, though. So 
                        this book has been an adventure. I've had to brush up 
                        on some definitions, sit and ponder a few things. The 
                        first problem I worked out today had to do with 
                        primitive Pythagorean triples, which is a 3-tuple of 
                        intergers $(X,Y,Z)$ such that $X^2+Y^2=Z^2$, with none 
                        of the intergers sharing a common factor. We suppose 
                        that $a>b$ without loss of generality, and say that 
                        they're not both odd, and relatively prime. The 
                        problem is to show that, given the relations 
					</p>

					<p>
						$$ X=a^2-b^2,\, Y=2ab,\, Z= a^2+b^2$$
					</p>

					<p>
						form a triple so-described, and that all primitive 
                        Pythagorean triples take this form. Showing that this 
                        is formulation of $(X,Y,Z)$ is a triple is simple, all 
                        that's needed is to recognize that these values 
                        fulfill the Pythagorean theorem. Showing that they 
                        form all primitive solutions is a little trickier. 
                        Letting both $a$ and $b$ be even, we see that $Y$ and 
                        $Z$ are no longer coprime. Similarly, if both $a$ and 
                        $b$ are odd, all $(X,Y,Z)$ become even, and thus no 
                        two of them are coprime. Thus, we need one of $(a,b)$ 
                        to be odd, and the other even.

						The reason we know <i>all</i> primitive triples are 
                        found this way is the most interesting part. The 
                        easiest way to see it is to draw a picture:

                    <div class="image">
					    <p style="text-align:center;">
						    <img src="unit.png" alt="Unit Circle with chord from (-1,0) to (u,v) in first quadrant" class="center">
					    </p>
                    </div>

					<p>
						Re-paramaterizing from 
                        $$ X=a^2-b^2,\, Y=2ab,\, Z= a^2+b^2$$ 
                        to 
                        $$u=\frac{X}{Z},\,v=\frac{Y}{Z}$$, 
                        we see that following the Pythagorean theorem leads us 
                        to know that $u^2+v^2=1$, naturally leading us to a 
                        parametrization of the unit circle. Cycling through 
                        the intergers for $a$ and $b$ gives us all possible 
                        Pythagorean triples.
