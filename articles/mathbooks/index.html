                        This is pretty much gonna be the same idea as the 
                        physics review list. I only split them up because it 
                        makes things easier to find.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here's a list of some of the math texts I have read. 
                        I'll make notes of the ones that are important texts 
                        in their fields, but I can speak a little more expertly 
                        about the physics texts because that's more my area.
                    </p>

                <h4 id="foundations">Foundations</h4>
                <h5><i>Set Theory and Metric Spaces</i>, Irving Kaplansky</h5>
                    <p>
                        Kaplansky's book is old-school, at times archaic, 
                        and uses fairly out-moded notation and terminology. 
                        It's also, in my opinion, an excellent treatise on 
                        the foundational elements of set theory and metric 
                        spaces. The first half of this concise volume (just
                        under 160 pages!) is devoted to developing set
                        algebra in both the finite and infinite cases,
                        developing a motivation for discussions of
                        cardinality and then cardinal and ordinal 
                        arithmetic. It completes this portion by introducing
                        the ZFC axioms which is nice to have, though
                        properly axiomatic set theory deserves its own
                        treatment in my opinion.  In the next section, he
                        covers the basics of metric spaces: completeness,
                        compactness, product spaces, and some more 
                        interesting results like Brauer's fixed-point theorem, 
                        and a teeny bit of category theory.
                        It caps off with the obvious next steps in point-set
                        topology and connections between set theory and
                        algebra.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a personal aside, this was the first "serious"
                        math textbook I ever read. It was passed to me by a
                        senior student while I was in freshman back in '13.
                        I enjoyed it very much then, even if it was a little
                        hard to parse - especially without knowing any pure
                        mathematics students at that time. Once one gets the
                        hang not just of Kaplansky's style but of how to
                        read and write mathematical proofs, and what real
                        proof entails, this text is smooth sailing. 
                    </p>

                <h4 id="algebra">Algebra</h4>
                <h5><i>Algebra</i>, Michael Artin</h5>
                    <p>
                        Artin has an unorthodox approach to algebra that is
                        not to everyone's taste. He starts with linear
                        algebra rather than the classic groups-rings-fields
                        approach, and only later gets to what one normally
                        thinks of as the "abstract algebra". This isn't
                        a bad thing, it's just a thing. I personally found
                        it helpful to start where it did given that my
                        background in linear algebra was already very strong
                        when I read his book, so the primer founding itself
                        in somewhere where my footing was solid made
                        understanding the later sections considerably
                        simpler.
                    </p>

            <h4 id="analysis">Analysis</h4>
                <h5><i>Complex Analysis</i>, Lars Ahlfors</h5>
                    <p>
                       This is generally regarded as one of those textbooks
                       that so-called "serious" mathematicians read in their
                       undergraduate studies. It hits all the major topics:
                       complex numbers and functions, mappings, contour
                       integration, conformal mappings and so on, as well as
                       some of the hot math topics like Riemann Zeta and
                       analytic continuation.  Ahlfors' text starts from a
                       peculiar point- assuming very little in the way of
                       knowledge of complex numbers, but simultaneously
                       assuming that the reader has at least basic knowledge
                       of abstract algebra. It has some dated terminology as
                       well, which isn't too surprising.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I liked this book quite a bit, and found it to be a
                        worthy supplement to the course notes for PMATH 352 at
                        Waterloo. The problems I found to be of adequate
                        difficulty to reinforce learning, without being so
                        hard that they send you immediately to the solutions
                        guide. My biggest criticism of the text is that the
                        geometric allusions are fairly weak. If that were a
                        greater concern, I would have included more figures
                        and made more emphasis of the connections. They seem
                        more like an afterthought. Perhaps something like
                        "visual complex analysis" would be a good additional
                        reference to those wanting a better geometric intuition.
