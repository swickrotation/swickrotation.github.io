                <h1>The GHZ Game</h1>
                <h4>November, 2018</h4>

            <div class="in-content">
                <p>
                    This semester I gave a second Alt-Tab talk to the University 
                    of Waterloo's Computer Science Club. Like last time, it was 
                    a topic related to quantum computing- this time, a game. 
                    Games provide a convienient middle-ground between physics 
                    and computer science through the application of information 
                    theory; which has wide-ranging implications from fields as 
                    far flung as data compression, linguistics, and black hole 
                    thermodynamics. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The point broke off my pencil just a tad though, in that I 
                    forgot the talk was supposed to be more heuristic than 
                    specific. I ended up getting a little too mathematical 
                    rather than stating the results and talking implications. To 
                    that end, I think it's fitting that I explain some of what 
                    was going on here, so that any interested attendees who were 
                    confused by the admittedly fast-and-loose math aren't left 
                    hanging. So without further ado, the GHZ game!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here's the scheme: we have three players in what we call a 
                    "cooperative game" which just means that all the players are 
                    not competing with each other, rather (in this case) with 
                    chance in the form of a referee who sends the players 
                    questions randomly. Each player, say Alice, Bob, and Charlie 
                    (later $A$, $B$, and $C$) are handed a question at random 
                    from the referee. The referee sends the question $r$ to 
                    Alice, $s$ to Bob, and $t$ to Charlie. Each of these 
                    participants respond with $a$, $b$, $c$ respectively. 
                    Here's a diagram to make things a little easier to chew-

                    We say that $r,s,t \in \{0,1\}$ and that the bit strings 
                    chosen uniformly by the referee are 
                    $rst \in \{000,011,101,110\}$. Each player takes the 
                    question corresponding to its position in the bit string and 
                    answers according to some strategy, such that with Alice 
                    returning the answer $a$ and so on, their answers 
                    $a,b,c \in \{0,1\}$. The game is won by the players if the 
                    addition modulo 2 of the bits $a,b,c$ is equal to the 
                    logical disjunction of the referee's questions: here's a 
                    table to for the winning outcomes.

                <p>
                    Well, how do we win this game? We can see from the table 
                    that if Alice, Bob, and Charlie answer 1 no matter what the 
                    referee passes to them, then they're going to win with a 
                    percentage approaching 75% after repeated trials. It turns 
                    out that there is no strategy that can win with 100% 
                    certainty, using a classical strategy. The proof of this is 
                    straightforward: summing the winning conditions modulo 2, 
                    we see that
                    $$
                    a_0 \oplus b_0 \oplus c_0 = 0 \\
                    a_0 \oplus b_1 \oplus c_1 = 1 \\ 
                    a_1 \oplus b_0 \oplus c_1 = 1 \\
                    a_1 \oplus b_1 \oplus c_0 = 1
                    $$
                    will yeild the result 0 = 1, which is a contradiction. It 
                    also turns out that 75% is the best we can hope for, as at 
                    least one of the above equations is going to give us a 
                    false result. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    An important point (though it's pretty simple once you 
                    reason through it) is that probabilistic strategies will not 
                    do better. A probabilistic strategy is just an average over 
                    a deterministic strategy, and you cannot have an average 
                    that is better than a best result. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Though it's not all doom and gloom, because we can use 
                    quantum effects to our advantage! If we allow Alice, Bob, 
                    and Charlie to share entangled bits before they are 
                    seperated, we can see that there are strategies which allow 
                    the players to win every game. Here's how it works: the 
                    players share an entangled state that looks something like 
                    $$\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{2}\ket{000}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{011}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{101}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{110}$$
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have the players, each operating in the standard basis, 
                    playing with the following strategy: if a player is passed a 
                    question with the value 1, that player applies a 
                    <a href="/articles/quantum-algorithms-primer#hadamard" , target="_blank">Hadamard</a> 
                    transformation to their qubit. If their question is of value 
                    0, they do nothing to their qubit. After they perform this 
                    operation, they measure their qubit return their answer to 
                    the referee. From this, we get two cases, mirroring what we 
                    have seen before.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first case is that in which the players recieve the 
                    bitstring $rst=000$ from the referee. This is pretty simple: 
                    in this case, all that is returned is 0 for each player, and 
                    thus they return $0 \oplus 0 \oplus 0 = 0$ to the referee. 
                    That's what we were hoping for! So far, so good.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The next case is a little trickier: if the players recieve 
                    any of the other 3 bitstrings, the play goes something like 
                    this. We assume that the bitstring received will be the case 
                    $rst=110$, but it works in a similar way for each case. In 
                    this case, Charlie gets the qubit $\ket{0}$ while Alice an 
                    Bob both end up with 
                    $$H\ket{1} = \frac{\ket{0}-\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}.$$
                </p>

                <p>
                    We remember that 
                    $$\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{2}\ket{000}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{011}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{101}-\frac{1}{2}\ket{110}\\
                    = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{00}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{11}\right)\ket{0}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{01}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{10}\right)\ket{1}.$$ 
                    From here, we see that upon applying hadamard gates to the 
                    first two qubits in each term, we get 
                    $$\left(H \otimes H\right)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{00}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{11}\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{01}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{10} \\
                    \left(H \otimes H\right)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{01}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{10}\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{00}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{11}$$
                </p>

                <p>
                    That's a cool result: the application of the Hadamard gates 
                    to each of these qubits returns terms that we saw in the 
                    original state $\ket{\psi}$. Putting this all together, 
                    we're going to get something like this:
                    $$\left(H \otimes H \otimes I\right)\ket{\psi} =  \frac{1}{2}\left(\ket{010}+\ket{100}+\ket{001}-\ket{111}\right)$$
                    which, upon measurement of $a \oplus b \oplus c$ will yeild 
                    the desired result of $1$ no matter which state is measured 
                    by each player. This will be the case regardless of what 
                    bitsting we recieve from the referee, by arguments of 
                    mathematical symmetry- though feel free to check for 
                    yourself!
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have demonstrated not only that this game in particular 
                    is solvable, but that there are quantum strategies to 
                    certain games that are <i>strictly better</i> than classical 
                    ones. This is a contrived example, but it is a proof of the 
                    concept, and helps motivate the field and justify further 
                    research.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you have any interest in classical information theory, I 
                    have to recommend Claude Shannon's foundational work 
                    <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf" target="_blank"><i>A Mathematical Theory of Communication</i></a>, 
                    which is in no exageration the work that originated the 
                    field. If you're more interested in quantum information 
                    theory, Waterloo's own John Watrous has recently published a 
                    book, 
                    <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/TQI/" target="_blank"><i>The Theory of Quantum Information</i></a>, 
                    a draft of which is linked- though you may find a hard copy 
                    of the text at Cambridge University Press. For those more 
                    interested in quantum theory's relation to mathematical 
                    games, I have few resources in mind, though there are 
                    portions in Nielsen and Chaung's gold-standard text on the 
                    field in broad strokes, namely 
                    <a href="http://csis.pace.edu/ctappert/cs837-18spring/QC-textbook.pdf" target="_blank"><i>Quantum Computation and Quantum Information</i></a>.
