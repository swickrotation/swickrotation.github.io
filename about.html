<h1>About</h1>
<img src="yourstruly.jpg" alt="Picture of the site owner" style="width:304px;height:420px;">

<p> Hey there, thanks for checking out my site. My name's Will, I'm a student of mathematical physics in the faculty of science at the University of Waterloo. My primary academic interests are in cosmology, quantum information and quantum computation, though I am dabbling and have done some small work in cryptography and security.</p>

<p> Outside of physics and mathematics, I'm also passionately political and have been an active member of numerous social justice initiatives over the years. At the moment I'm taking a small hiatus from that work to lead the Undergraduate Physics Society of the University of Waterloo (PhysClub).</p>

<p> I'm also an avid reader of literature and imbiber of visual and auditory art. Particular favourites in visual art are Toulouse-Lautrec, Edvard Munch, M.C. Escher, and Amedeo Modigliani. As for music, I place Miles above all else, and then a selection of other favourites are Bon Iver, Frank Ocean, Hey Rosetta!, Kendrick Lamar, Radiohead, Beethoven, Dead Kennedys, and recently LCD Soundsystem. Literature's a bit too mean a question to ask me to rank, but the book I've enjoyed the most this year has been GEB.</p>

<p> Want to reach out, get in contact, or see some of the other things I get up to? Here's a link to some of my contact information and social media, as well as my Git. Enjoy!
