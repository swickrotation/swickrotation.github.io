						Holy hell was I ever sick. From about May 22nd to maybe this past Sunday, I was really just floored. 
						Tonsillitis is no joke- I'd never want to catch that chronically. While I was under, though, I managed 
						to put a dent in some books and papers- Nielsen and Chuang, Artin, and John Watrous's new book on QI 
						theory- which was definitely written for CS people. Still pretty good! Thinking I might try to go back to 
						one of my old jobs instead of just free-forming my studies until the fall. That's all that's really been
						going on lately in a professional way. Apart from that, I went to Toronto and met up with some of the family
						this past week- Toronto island is actually really nice! I should really get to the city more often- I hardly 
						know it at all, it's a little tricky to keep telling people it's my hometown when the only neighbourhood I know
						at all is the kind of Palmerston-St. George-Kensington triangle.

						It's looking like I'm going to be sticking around KW, at least for the foreseeable future. 
						Nothing terribly concrete until the new semester starts in September, but for the now I'm gonna 
						bounce from group to group to group theory and try to catch up on the current state of the art. 
						Man, is there ever a gap in undergraduate education- Even now I'm still getting the hang of reading 
						research papers. We should have more workshops on this, or something. Even if it isn't vital for
						<i>everyone</i>, it's still really important for anyone continuing in research work. Anyway, in the
						mean time, I'm also doing some consulting work, but that's a little cloak-and-dagger, for the time 
						being. As for the site, I've updated the reading recommendations a little, but it's still kinda barren.
						That's gonna need some more work. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Still writing up this applied crypto paper- I'll post all about it and reveal my accomplice when we're 
						done (though it's liable to be some more time.) Today I've decided to refresh algebra- I'm plowing through 
						Artin's text right now. It's a little on the wordy side, but pretty much just enough to be clear. Not fluff, 
						rather elucidation. It's pretty self-contained too, which is a major plus for me, giving my fixation on 
						starting on page one instead of where what I'm immediately interested in starts. 
					</p>

					<p>
						A bunch of my friends have moved away by now, so while the summer semester is usually pretty empty, it's even 
						more barren here. But some friends from the coast are moving Ontario-way in the coming months, and I'm looking 
						forward to being able to see them.

						A lot of the reason I read a particular textbook has to do with its portability. I've got a 
						lot of moving around to do over the course of the day. If I want to kill the commute time, 
						reading has always been my go-to. Reading on the bus is kinda nice, but if you've got a text
						that's a little too large, it can be prohibitive. Not to mention the fact that you've got to 
						carry it around all day. Fortunately, there are a plentitude of texts that fit <i>right in 
						your pocket!</i> The one I picked off the shelf today is called <i>Introduction to Elliptic
						Curves and Modular Forms</i>, by a guy named Neal Koblitz. He's a cryptographer at the 
						university of Washington, and an adjunct faculty member here at Waterloo.
					</p>
			
					<p>
						I don't actually know any number theory, though. So this book has been an adventure. I've
						had to brush up on some definitions, sit and ponder a few things. The first problem I worked 
						out today had to do with primitive Pythagorean triples, which is a 3-tuple of intergers 
						$(X,Y,Z)$ such that $X^2+Y^2=Z^2$, with none of the intergers sharing a common factor.
						We suppose that $a>b$ without loss of generality, and say that they're not both odd, 
						and relatively prime. The problem is to show that, given the relations 
					</p>

					<p>
						$$ X=a^2-b^2,\, Y=2ab,\, Z= a^2+b^2$$
					</p>

					<p>
						form a triple so-described, and that all primitive Pythagorean triples take this form. 
						Showing that this is formulation of $(X,Y,Z)$ is a triple is simple, all that's needed is to 
						recognize that these values fulfill the Pythagorean theorem. Showing that they form all 
						primitive solutions is a little trickier. Letting both $a$ and $b$ be even, we see that $Y$ 
						and $Z$ are no longer coprime. Similarly, if both $a$ and $b$ are odd, all $(X,Y,Z)$ become 
						even, and thus no two of them are coprime. Thus, we need one of $(a,b)$ to be odd, and the 
						other even.
					</p>

					<p>
						The reason we know <i>all</i> primitive triples are found this way is the most interesting 
						part. The easiest way to see it is to draw a picture:

					<p style="text-align:center;">
						<img src="img/unit.png" alt="Unit Circle with chord from (-1,0) to (u,v) in first quadrant" class="center">
					</p>

					<p>
						Re-paramaterizing from $$ X=a^2-b^2,\, Y=2ab,\, Z= a^2+b^2$$ to $$u=\frac{X}{Z},\,v=\frac{Y}{Z}$$, 
						we see that following the Pythagorean theorem leads us to know that $u^2+v^2=1$, naturally leading 
						us to a parametrization of the unit circle. Cycling through the intergers for $a$ and $b$ gives us 
						all possible Pythagorean triples.

						Alright, check this out. I think this is pretty funny. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Theorem: Almost every natural number is really, really big. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Proof: Suppose we take some number $n \in \mathbb{N}$  to be a threshold of "really, really 
						big" such that if we add any number $k \in \mathbb{N}$ to $n$, the number $n+k$ is also 
						"really, really big" and if we subtract any number $m \in \mathbb{N}$ from $n$, the number 
						$n-m$ is not "really, really big". Then, since the naturals are bounded from below and 
						unbounded from above, we have finitely many numbers below $n$ and infinitely many numbers 
						above $n$. Thus, all but finitely many natural numbers are "really, really big".

						Note: recently, a nice math student told me what a "filter" was, so I'll probably have to 
						clean this post up a little bit. I'll put it on the to-do list. Future me can deal with that.

				<a><h1>Your Signature, not your John Hancock: A Note on Conventions</h1></a>
				<hr>
				<div class="in-content">
					<p>
						The point of this post is two-fold: First, I've just tried to implement MathJax in the site, 
						and I'm gonna try to test it out. If you're seeing this, it probably worked. Secondly, I've 
						been thinking a lot about conventions in physics, how they're useful, when they're not, and 
						what we gain by thinking about them. In a more abstract sense, the line of thought leads 
						(or at least has lead me) to the unsurprising but important realization that the order in 
						which learn things can substantially effect our tastes, and not always benignly. 	
					</p>
					
					<p>
						So I've been taking a course called "Quantum Field Theory for Cosmology" at Perimeter this 
						semester. It's a spiritual successor to a course I took the previous semester, which focused 
						on general relativity. In both of these courses, we've got this thing called a "metric", 
						which is essentially a way of telling us how far away certain events are in spacetime. In 
						Minkowski (flat) spacetime, we've got two ways of representing the metric. In general 
						relativity and quantum gravity, the convention is: 

						$$
						\eta^{\mu \nu}= \eta_{\mu \nu} =

						\begin{pmatrix}
							-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
							0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
							0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
							0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
						\end{pmatrix}
						$$

						and in quantum field theory and particle physics, the convention is

						$$
						\eta^{\mu \nu}= \eta_{\mu \nu}=

						\begin{pmatrix}
							1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
							0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
							0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\
							0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
						\end{pmatrix} 
						$$
					</p>

					<p>
						It's important to note for the non-specialist that these will give you the same physics, 
						as long as you're consistent in your choice. I'll give an example: take the Lagrangian 
						density of a real scalar field-

						$$
						\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}\eta_{\mu \nu}\partial_{\mu}\phi\partial_{\nu}\phi - 
						\frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2
						$$

						This is going to look a little different depending on our choice of metric: in the first, 
						it's going to be 

						$$
						-\frac{1}{2}\dot{\phi}^2 + \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\phi)^2-\frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2
						$$

						and in the second, 

						$$
						\frac{1}{2}\dot{\phi}^2 - \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\phi)^2-\frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2
						$$

						Solving the equations of motion, 

						$$\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\phi} = -m^2\phi \quad , 
						\quad \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_{\mu}\phi)} 
						= (-\dot{\phi}, \nabla\phi)$$

						Very similarly, in the second metric, 

						$$\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\phi} = -m^2\phi \quad , 
						\quad \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_{\mu}\phi)} 
						= (\dot{\phi}, -\nabla\phi)$$

						These both lead to very similar Euler-Lagrange equations:

						$$\ddot{\phi} - \nabla^2\phi+m^2\phi = 0$$

						For the negative signature, or

						$$-\ddot{\phi} + \nabla^2\phi+m^2\phi = 0 $$

						for the positive. 

						These both lead to, in relativistic notation, identical reductions to what is termed the 
						Klein-Gordon equation:

						$$(\partial^{\mu}\partial_{\mu} + m^2)\phi = 0$$


						So they both work. I first learned the first one, and so in the tribal way that people tend 
						towards, I decided it was the best way to do things and that the other way wasn't as good. 
						But they both have their strengths and their weaknesses, but only really in the aspects that 
						become more obvious depending on the sign. For the (+,-,-,-) convention, you get timelike 
						4-vectors with positive magnitude. For (-,+,+,+), you keep familiar 3-d formalism. You also 
						don't have to worry about your determinant flipping in a generalized dimensionality case.  
						It's an aesthetic choice, and (as far as I can tell) nothing deper. I still prefer the first 
						one, but only because I'm used to it. I don't think that the other one is inferior anymore. 
					</p>

					<p>
						The point I'm trying to make, and I swear there is one, is that I've been thinking a lot 
						these past couple of days about how much of what we learn is stylistic in nature rather than 
						substantiative, and the interrelation of style and substance. No serious conclusions yet, but 
						I'm going to use this example as a reminder to be more open-minded about ways to frame 
						information, ways of knowing, and ways of understanding.
