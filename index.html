<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>	This is my personal site. On it I will be posting a mixture of things including (but not limited to) my academic interests, my professional history and resume, stuff about projects I've worked on, and some blog-style posts about things I find cool and what's going on in my life. Hope you enjoy, and maybe find some small thing illuminating! -31/10/16</p>

<p>	Obviously this site is pretty sketch right now. It's a work in progress. At the moment I'm using this project as an excuse to re-learn HTML and CSS, and maybe pick up some bootstrap or JS. If it says I know HTML/CSS on my resume, it might as well be true, right? So bear with me while I sort this out. To paraphrase David Sedaris, me code pretty one day. -01/11/16</p>

<p>	Production of the site might slow down for the next couple of days, I'm off staying with my friend James in Toronto from Thursday to probably Sunday, no definite plan as of yet. I've been in this place too long, a few days change of scenery might be helpful in clearing up my headspace. Lets hope so. -02/11/16</p>

<p> Hello Toronto! Here I am, sitting on the 4th floor of the Scott library at York University. I wouldn't say that campus is pretty here, but it's certainly different than UW and at the very least it's got the leg up in terms of public art on campus. Today's TODO includes this small update, maybe a few touches to the index, but honestly nothing big. On the other hand, I've got about 6 hours to crack through Stinson's Cryptography, so it's back to the grind. Same ciphers, different scene. -03/11/16</p>

<p> Today managed to cut through the first chapter of Stinson's crypto. Feeling pretty good about it, but frankly so far the book is just a reminder about how little I know about discrete math. It inspires a bit of dissonance, there's definite pedagogical intent in the text but a lot of it is aimed at topics which seem fairly elementary, and then makes some assertions about the readers understanding, which seem (again, to me) to be fairly elementary. Either way, I had never seen the Hill cipher before so that was neat. Shannon theory is up next. -04/11/16</p>

<p> Not too much work today, presently sitting in a soon-to-close cafe in Kensington Market. Read a little crypto but spent the majority of the day just hanging out and catching up with old friends. Seriously considering doing grad school at U of T now, Toronto is miles ahead in terms of the scene, and it's in proximity to where I have already estalished a community. We'll see.  -05/11/16</p>

<p> Still hitting the books, in downtown again today. I've decided to stay in Toronto for another day, will be heading back to Waterloo Monday afternoon. Robarts library is a bit intense from the outside, but is actually pretty cool inside. Makes DC/DP look like a study room. It's kind of nice how close it is to all the other stuff around campus, too. Think I could get used to Toronto, though that might just be my present aversion to KW speaking. -06/11/16 </p>

<p> Back from Toronto, but today's been a total right-off. Not much to report. Actual site work will resume in the morning (or afternoon or something).  -07/11/16</p>

<p> Woke up a little late this morning after having watched the election. I happen to turn 21 today. Frankly, this isn't how I wanted my year to start. It is important that we now resolve to keep striving for a better world, that we resolve to cast off the politics of fear, the politics of cowardice, the politics of hate. We all have a stake in this. The United States does not exist in a vacuum. This is our Earth and it is our responsibility, every one of us, to keep fighting for a better future. It is now more than ever time to roll up our sleeves and protect the vulnerable, the underprivileged, and the meek. Now is the time. -09/11/16</p>

<p> First update in a while. I haven't lost interest in this project, I'm simply too occupied to follow through with it at the moment, or at least I was. I'll probably continue a little more earnestly on the aesthetic developments this week. A lot is going on and it's a little hard to put much time into this, but maybe writing it down will force me to work on it. Cheers for now. -13/11/16</p>

<p> Had a really interesting thing happen in conversation the other day. I was speaking to a friend of mine in the undergraduate study room in the physics building, and at some point made some damn fool ironic remark which didn't take right away. We had to take a few moments and explain to each other what we both meant and understood. After a bit of pause and some mulling over my friend turns and says to me "why is there so much?" or something to that effect. I take my friend to be expressing frustration and exhaustion under the pressure of the work, under social pressures, under life, and love, and money, and time. I take my friend to be complaining about the things bearing down on all of us. I try to make some show-off analogy about that guy in The Crucible, Giles Corey, who asks for more weight when being pressed to death. The point was to say that we do a lot of it to ourselves, that we demand a lot of ourselves and that the culture we've set up in physics demands that kind of self-castigating behaviour. To my embarrasment I go on this long rant about Giles Corey and Arthur Miller and how we all aught to cut ourselves more slack than we do, but my friend had been merely observing the layers of irony and sarcasm and lementing that it wasn't easier to follow. Now I had misunderstood. The irony of the whole situation, at this point, was not lost on me. But what's more interesting than the irony was that the assumption I made about the subject had almost nothing to do with what was going on outside of my head and everything to do with how I was feeling and what I was thinking about. It's the first time I've ever really obviously betrayed what I was thinking like that. It made me feel a little more alienated, it reminded me how much time I spend in my own head, and it made me want to get out of it more than I do now. -14/11/16</p>

<p> Today's TODO re: crypto project- get R back up and running after OS upgrade fucked everything up, re-run statistical analysis of the data gathered to-date. Nothing too tricky. -20/11/16 </p>


<p> Still working on the crypto project, probably about to finish up the language filter for our dataset. Smooth sailing so far, but there's a lot of python I don't know (or have forgotten), so it's not moving as quickly as I might like it to. My partner in crime made a major advance this week though, so we're making a good pace and I'm excited to be really moving forward again. -05/12/16 </p>

<p> Finished the language filter yesterday morning. All that's left is to  output the view counts into a data file. Only problem is that the dataset is enormous and it takes a long time to parse. Each hourly pagecount is something like 200 MB's, which is gigantic for a text file. To put that into perspective, the average album of 320 kbs mp3 files is something like 100 MB's. It's huge. But progress has been made and I'm pleased with the work having gone into it thus far. On a related note, still have a big gap in knowledge when it comes to Markov processes, currently plowing through Shiryaev's book on probability theory to rectify that. It's comprehensive, but it really falls into the stereotype of how brutal Russian mathematical texts are. I swear to God, the only time I get any work done is during the exam period. Thank goodness the courses I'm taking aren't really demanding, the only thing holding me back right now is cosmology. I wish someone would just hand me a degree already so I could devote all my time to research. I've certainly been acting enough like a grad student lately to justify it, and even have some of the actual grad students fooled as they keep sending me emails about GSA events. One of these years...</p>
