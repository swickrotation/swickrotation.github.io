<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>	This is my personal site. On it I will be posting a mixture of things including (but not limited to) my academic interests, my professional history and resume, stuff about projects I've worked on, and some blog-style posts about things I find cool and what's going on in my life. Hope you enjoy, and maybe find some small thing illuminating! -31/10/16</p>

<p>	Obviously this site is pretty sketch right now. It's a work in progress. At the moment I'm using this project as an excuse to re-learn HTML and CSS, and maybe pick up some bootstrap or JS. If it says I know HTML/CSS on my resume, it might as well be true, right? So bear with me while I sort this out. To paraphrase David Sedaris, me code pretty one day. -01/11/16</p>

<p>	Production of the site might slow down for the next couple of days, I'm off staying with my friend James in Toronto from Thursday to probably Sunday, no definite plan as of yet. I've been in this place too long, a few days change of scenery might be helpful in clearing up my headspace. Lets hope so. -02/11/16</p>

<p> Hello Toronto! Here I am, sitting on the 4th floor of the Scott library at York University. I wouldn't say that campus is pretty here, but it's certainly different than UW and at the very least it's got the leg up in terms of public art on campus. Today's TODO includes this small update, maybe a few touches to the index, but honestly nothing big. On the other hand, I've got about 6 hours to crack through Stinson's Cryptography, so it's back to the grind. Same ciphers, different scene. -03/11/16</p>

<p> Today managed to cut through the first chapter of Stinson's crypto. Feeling pretty good about it, but frankly so far the book is just a reminder about how little I know about discrete math. It inspires a bit of dissonance, there's definite pedagogical intent in the text but a lot of it is aimed at topics which seem fairly elementary, and then makes some assertions about the readers understanding, which seem (again, to me) to be fairly elementary. Either way, I had never seen the Hill cipher before so that was neat. Shannon theory is up next. -04/11/16</p>

<p> Not too much work today, presently sitting in a soon-to-close cafe in Kensington Market. Read a little crypto but spent the majority of the day just hanging out and catching up with old friends. Seriously considering doing grad school at U of T now, Toronto is miles ahead in terms of the scene, and it's in proximity to where I have already estalished a community. We'll see.  -05/11/16</p>

<p> Still hitting the books, in downtown again today. I've decided to stay in Toronto for another day, will be heading back to Waterloo Monday afternoon. Robarts library is a bit intense from the outside, but is actually pretty cool inside. Makes DC/DP look like a study room. It's kind of nice how close it is to all the other stuff around campus, too. Think I could get used to Toronto, though that might just be my present aversion to KW speaking. -06/11/16 </p>

<p> Back from Toronto, but today's been a total right-off. Not much to report. Actual site work will resume in the morning (or afternoon or something).  -07/11/16</p>

<p> Woke up a little late this morning after having watched the election. I happen to turn 21 today. Frankly, this isn't how I wanted my year to start. It is important that we now resolve to keep striving for a better world, that we resolve to cast off the politics of fear, the politics of cowardice, the politics of hate. We all have a stake in this. The United States does not exist in a vacuum. This is our Earth and it is our responsibility, every one of us, to keep fighting for a better future. It is now more than ever time to roll up our sleeves and protect the vulnerable, the underprivileged, and the meek. Now is the time. -09/11/16</p>

<p> First update in a while. I haven't lost interest in this project, I'm simply too occupied to follow through with it at the moment, or at least I was. I'll probably continue a little more earnestly on the aesthetic developments this week. A lot is going on and it's a little hard to put much time into this, but maybe writing it down will force me to work on it. Cheers for now. -13/11/16</p>
