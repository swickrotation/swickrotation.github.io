						Right, it's been over a full semester since the last update. A lot has happened. Made a few new friends, lost a few old ones, and was out, then in, then out of a couple romantic relationships. Managed to get to Fredericton for all of four days and three nights. I learned a lot of math, which seems to be more and more what I study these days. I tried my hand at a few projects; some of which failed while others succeeded. I've learned a lot about myself, and how to manage some limitations that I previously had not allowed myself to accept. 
					</p>

					<p>
						I was without address (read: couch-surfing) for two months and change, from late July to early October. This wasn't the first time that I've had to do a stint living the life of a real transient, but with some more hard work and a fair wind, it will be the last time. That being said, if anyone wants to talk about bootstraps and treat poverty as anything other than a chronic condition, they would do well to talk to me about it. I've got a solid place to live right now, in an arrangement I can expect to hold for quite enough time.  
					</p>

					<p>
						Ok, so what am I up to right now? Well, one of my successful projects is nearing completion, and with luck there'll be a pre-pub on arXiv by the end of the year. This semester I'm taking courses in quantum physics and theory, electrodynamics, and further coursework in general relativity. It's exciting. I've also read a ton of books in the last couple of months, the notable ones being On the Road, Madame Bovary, and Fifteen Dogs. The last one was pretty fun because it largely took part in my old neighbourhood in Toronto, and made explicit reference to the intersection nearest my earliest place of residence.

						Ok, so in rather unfortunate timing, I lost my Grandmother on Sunday afternoon. Thankfully, the first week is the easiest to miss, and so I hopped the nearest transport to Montreal. My grandmother was really cool, and we miss her a lot. I'll post in a few about her activism, but for now I'm busy getting things together for her funeral this Thursday.

						Tomorrow marks the first day of one of my final semesters at the University of Waterloo, at the very least as an undergraduate student. This semester is mostly patching holes in coursework I should have probably officially taken by now, so I'll use the coinciding downtime to do more thinking about what I want to do post-degree. Presently I only have vague notions of wanting to do work in RQI and QG, but I'm not well-acquainted enough to know exactly where to start. For now, learning as much math as I can seems like a good option. A friend of mine handed me <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0946">this paper</a>, which implies that if gravitation can only be moddled classically, that gravity cannot create entanglement between gravitationally coupled resonators. To me, this would imply that if you can show (experimentally?) that you can entangle systems with gravity, that a model descibing such an interaction well would be a pretty good start for a theory of quantum gravity. However, the paper relies on a lot of math I don't know yet, particularly in stochastics, so I didn't follow into super-rigorous detail.
