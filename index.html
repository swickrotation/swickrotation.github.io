<p>	This is my personal site. On it I will be posting a mixture of things including (but not limited to) my academic interests, my professional history and resume, stuff about projects I've worked on, and some blog-style posts about things I find cool and what's going on in my life. Hope you enjoy, and maybe find some small thing illuminating!</p>
