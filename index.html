<p>	This is my personal site. On it I will be posting a mixture of things including (but not limited to) my academic interests, my professional history and resume, stuff about projects I've worked on, and some blog-style posts about things I find cool and what's going on in my life. Hope you enjoy, and maybe find some small thing illuminating! -31/10/16</p>

<p>	Obviously this site is pretty sketch right now. It's a work in progress. At the moment I'm using this project as an excuse to re-learn HTML and CSS, and maybe pick up some bootstrap or JS. If it says I know HTML/CSS on my resume, it might as well be true, right? So bear with me while I sort this out. To paraphrase David Sedaris, me code pretty one day. -01/11/16</p>

<p>	Production of the site might slow down for the next couple of days, I'm off staying with my friend James in Toronto from Thursday to probably Sunday, no definite plan as of yet. I've been in this place too long, a few days change of scenery might be helpful in clearing up my headspace. Lets hope so. -02/11/16</p>
