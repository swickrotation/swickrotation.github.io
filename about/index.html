				<h1>Academic Interests, personal history</h1>
					<p>
                        I'm a researcher at the University of Waterloo.  My
                        specialization is in black hole thermodynamics and
                        quantum information theory. I was born in 
                        <a href= "trinity.jpg", target="_blank">downtown Toronto</a>, and raised in <a href= "fredericton.jpg", target="_blank"> Fredericton, New Brunswick</a>.  
                        The streetcorner I lived on in Toronto is mentioned in André Alexis' 
                        <em property="italic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_Dogs"> Fifteen Dogs</em>.  
                        Broadly speaking, my primary academic interests are in 
                        cosmology, quantum information, and quantum gravity. I
                        dabble in pure math, cryptography, and network
                        security for fun and for perspective. I have an
                        aesthetic taste for algebra over analysis, though find
                        myself using analytic techniques more often.
                        Previously, I've worked as a researcher in optical
                        physics for both 
                        <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/femtoexplosion/home/", target="_blank">public</a> 
                        and 
                        <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/23/18010468/north-focals-glasses-thalmic-labs ", target= "_blank">private</a> 
                        organizations.
					</p>

				    <h1>What else am I into?</h1>
					<p> 
                        Outside of work I appreciate film, fine arts, music, 
                        literature, cycling, sailing, and hanging out in hip 
                        cafés both with and without my friends. I also must
                        admit a particularity when it comes to stationary. I
                        prefer to write with fountain pens, and writing on paper
                        as much as I do I feel slightly less guilty about
                        spending as much as I have on my fairly small
                        collection. 
					</p>

                    <p>
                        I am also driven to distraction by my political
                        inclinations, which lie far to the left of "center".
                        I think that a country with as vast wealth and
                        resources as the one in which I was born has a moral
                        responsibility to use these resources to help the many,
                        and to use its influence to make sure the world we all
                        share stays safe and habitable for all who live here. To
                        wit, I believe as well that it is incumbent on every
                        person to do what they can to help those around them in
                        whatever capacity they have - in physics, this means
                        using technical knowledge for good, and elevating
                        voices in our community that all too often go unheard.

                        If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in 
                        Mathematics, I would be Frank Warner's 
                        <b><i>Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and 
                        Lie Groups</i></b>.
                    </p>	
                        
                    <p> 
                        I give a clear, detailed, and careful development of 
                        the basic facts on manifold theory and Lie Groups. I 
                        include differentiable manifolds, tensors and 
                        differentiable forms. Lie groups and homogenous spaces, 
                        integration on manifolds, and in addition provide a 
                        proof of the de Rham theorem via sheaf cohomology 
                        theory, and develop the local theory of elliptic 
                        operators culminating in a proof of the Hodge theorem. 
                        Those interested in any of the diverse areas of 
                        mathematics requiring the notion of a differentiable 
                        manifold will find me extremely useful.
