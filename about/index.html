                <p>
                    Here you can find a brief summary of my academic
                    and professional experience.

			<h1>Personal History and Present Status</h1>

                <p>
                    In a past life I was a researcher at the University of
                    Waterloo. My specialization was in black hole
                    thermodynamics and quantum information theory. During and
                    after graduate school I worked extensively as a bartender.
                    The skills I learned in that trade have been just as helpful
                    if not more-so. I lived and worked in Waterloo, ON, from my
                    time as an undergraduate until the summer of 2024. I now
                    reside in Montreal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was born in downtown Toronto, and raised in Fredericton,
                    New Brunswick.  The streetcorner I lived on in Toronto is
                    mentioned in André Alexis' <em property="italic"
                    href="/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_Dogs">
                    Fifteen Dogs</em>. Besides the note above  I've worked as a
                    tutor, a troubleshooter, a consultant, a web developer, as
                    a full-stack construction labourer (built a whole house one
                    semester!) and as a researcher in optical physics for both <a href =
                    "https://sites.google.com/site/femtoexplosion/home/", target="_blank">public</a> 
                    and <a href= "https://bit.ly/3eS1TKM", target= "_blank"> private</a>
                    organizations.
                </p>

                <h1>What else am I into?</h1>
                <p> 
                    Outside of work I appreciate film, fine arts, music,
                    literature, cycling, sailing, and hanging out in hip cafés
                    both with and without my friends. I must also admit a
                    particularity when it comes to stationary, and when it
                    comes to the software I use. I've got interests in
                    political philosophy and foreign languages, in particular
                    those spoken by my forebears &mdash; Yiddish, Russian,
                    German, and French being the foci. I'm not religious, but
                    I was raised in a Jewish household and maintain cultural
                    ties. It's a little tricky to explain, but you'd probably
                    know what I meant if you met me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics,
                    I would be Saunders Mac Lane's <b><i>Categories for the
                    Working Mathematician</i></b>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I provide an array of general ideas useful in a wide
                    variety of fields.  Starting from foundations, I
                    illuminate the concepts of category, functor, natural
                    transformation, and duality.  I then turn to adjoint
                    functors, which provide a description of universal
                    constructions, an analysis of the representation of
                    functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating
                    direct and inverse limits.
