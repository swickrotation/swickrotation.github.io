			<h1>Academic Interests, personal history</h1>
			<p>
                I'm a researcher at the University of Waterloo. My
                specialization is in black hole thermodynamics and quantum
                information theory. I was born in downtown Toronto, and raised
                in Fredericton, New Brunswick.  The streetcorner I lived on in
                Toronto is mentioned in André Alexis' <em property="italic"
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_Dogs"> Fifteen
                    Dogs</em>.
                Broadly speaking, my primary academic interests are in
                mathematical physics, general relativity, and quantum fields. 
                I dabble in pure math, theoretical computer science, and
                numerical relativity for fun and for perspective. I have an
                aesthetic taste for algebra over analysis, though find myself
                using analytic techniques more often.  Previously, I've worked
                as a researcher in optical physics for both 
                <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/femtoexplosion/home/",
                    target="_blank">public</a> and
                <a href= "https://bit.ly/3eS1TKM", target= "_blank"> private</a>
                organizations.
            </p>

		    <h1>What else am I into?</h1>
			<p> 
                Outside of work I appreciate film, fine arts, music,
                literature, cycling, sailing, and hanging out in hip cafés
                both with and without my friends. I also must admit a
                particularity when it comes to stationary, and when it comes
                to the software I use. I've got interests in political
                philosophy and foreign languages, in particular those spoken by
                my forebears &mdash; Yiddish, Russian, German, and French being
                the foci. I'm not religious, but I was raised in a Jewish
                household and maintain much of the traditional and cultural
                practice very strongly. It's a little tricky to explain, but
                you'd probably know what I meant if you met me.
		    </p>

            <p>
                I am also driven to distraction by my political inclinations,
                which are primarily influenced by Marx. I'm not entirely sure
                what Marxist physics is supposed to look like, but I can safely
                say it involves lifting academic physics out of the clutches of
                military and industrial research which bankrolls so much
                development, and moving the field towards problems that address
                problems the world over will face. In particular when it comes
                to modes of energy production. It also means highlighting and
                emphasizing the work being done by those whose works go
                too-often ignored and too-often overwritten for reasons of
                biggotry. It means working to ensure that the departmental
                PR-speak about diversity, inclusion, and equity doesn't stop at
                the annual board report, but that real action is taken. And,
                because people working in physics do have some cultural sway,
                it means using that sway to highlight important issues in our
                community from the local to the global level.

                I provide an array of general ideas useful in a wide variety
                of fields.  Starting from foundations, I illuminate the
                concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and
                duality.  I then turn to adjoint functors, which provide a
                description of universal constructions, an analysis of the
                representation of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means
                of manipulating direct and inverse limits.
