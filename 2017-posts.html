						Ahoy-hoy! I started this site a year ago yesterday. So far, most of my time working on it 
						has been devoted to superficial things- in particular the design of the site and fixing bugs 
						with the CSS code. I'm pretty happy with it so far. I think I'll start posting some more 
						technical things, once I can figure out how to get mathjax working on the site. That shouldn't 
						be so hard, but this isn't exactly my only project.

						One of those failed projects that I talked about in the last post was a sort of 
						"undergraduate wiki" that I was going to implement and distribute around for the new folk 
						coming into UW, or for people in upper-years who might want some more specific advice. 
						A few meetings with department folks later, and some 35 pages in, I found it wasn't going 
						to be implementable alone. I tried to get some other folk on board for the project and while 
						there was enthusiasm for the idea, there wasn't enough impetus among potential co-writers for 
						the project to take traction. However, not all is lost: I think that the book reviews are still
						 pretty useful. I'm posting all of that in the archive section. I hope you find something you like!

						Right, it's been over a full semester since the last update. A lot has happened. 
						Made a few new friends, lost a few old ones, and was out, then in, then out of a couple 
						romantic relationships. Managed to get to Fredericton for all of four days and three nights. 
						I learned a lot of math, which seems to be more and more what I study these days. I tried my 
						hand at a few projects; some of which failed while others succeeded. I've learned a lot about 
						myself, and how to manage some limitations that I previously had not allowed myself to accept. 
					</p>

					<p>
						I was without address (read: couch-surfing) for two months and change, from late July to 
						early October. This wasn't the first time that I've had to do a stint living the life of a 
						real transient, but with some more hard work and a fair wind, it will be the last time. That 
						being said, if anyone wants to talk about bootstraps and treat poverty as anything other than 
						a chronic condition, they would do well to talk to me about it. I've got a solid place to live 
						right now, in an arrangement I can expect to hold for quite enough time.  
					</p>

					<p>
						Ok, so what am I up to right now? Well, one of my successful projects is nearing 
						completion, and with luck there'll be a pre-pub on arXiv by the end of the year. This 
						semester I'm taking courses in quantum physics and theory, electrodynamics, and further 
						coursework in general relativity. It's exciting. I've also read a ton of books in the last 
						couple of months, the notable ones being Candide, On the Road, Madame Bovary, and Fifteen 
						Dogs. The last one was pretty fun because it largely took part in my old neighbourhood in 
						Toronto, and made explicit reference to the intersection nearest my earliest place of 
						residence.

						Ok, so in rather unfortunate timing, I lost my Grandmother on Sunday afternoon. Thankfully, 
						the first week is the easiest to miss, and so I hopped the nearest transport to Montreal. My 
						grandmother was really cool, and we miss her a lot. I'll post in a few about her activism, 
						but for now I'm busy getting things together for her funeral this Thursday.

					<p>
						Tomorrow marks the first day of one of my final semesters at the University of Waterloo, 
						at the very least as an undergraduate student. This semester is mostly patching holes in 
						coursework I should have probably officially taken by now, so I'll use the coinciding 
						downtime to do more thinking about what I want to do post-degree. Presently I only have 
						vague notions of wanting to do work in RQI and QG, but I'm not well-acquainted enough to 
						know exactly where to start. For now, learning as much math as I can seems like a good 
						option. A friend of mine handed me 
						<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0946">this paper</a>, 
						which implies that if gravitation can only be moddled classically, that gravity cannot 
						create entanglement between gravitationally coupled resonators. To me, this would imply 
						that if you can show (experimentally?) that you can entangle systems with gravity, that 
						a model descibing such an interaction well would be a pretty good start for a theory of 
						quantum gravity. However, the paper relies on a lot of math I don't know yet, particularly 
						in stochastics, so I didn't follow into super-rigorous detail.
